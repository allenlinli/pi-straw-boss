// The key pad's keys (POST …/sessions/<key>/keys {key, stream, confirmed?}), checked in order after the write guards and the registry:
// the key is on the pad and alone, at most 8 a second per session; the page's stream holds this session's mirror, on its pane, and got a
// frame in the last 3 s; while the session file's open call is `secret_drop` or the unit has an answerable dialog, only Escape (the same on every page, a paired device's too); while it has an open `link_request` call a paired device (`remote`) too sends only Escape (its approval is given on this computer only, and Enter in the terminal confirm is Yes); Enter asks
// the session's bridge what it would submit (probe.ts), checks the mirror, the secret, and the dialog again after the answer, and needs the
// confirm the server names for an ending command, another `/` or `!` command, or an editor it could not read. An Enter that names the answer which put a command in the prompt (`run`, runs.ts) passes the `command`
// confirm alone, and only when the bridge's MAC of the prompt line (under the nonce the grant gave with the probe) is the MAC of that command: a line edited, emptied, or turned into text since, another session's or an unknown, spent, or stale answer is refused (run_changed, run_unknown, run_expired), and an old bridge's `command` line without a MAC gets the confirm. A second Escape within 1 s
// (from when Herdr took the first) to a session that neither works nor waits runs pi's double-Escape action, so it needs a confirm; once
// confirmed both Escapes go, as two writes 60 ms apart (one write of two ESC bytes reads as Ctrl+Alt+[ to a terminal without the kitty
// protocol, and pi pairs Escapes only within 500 ms), or one if the confirm came within 450 ms of the first, which pi pairs with it.
// Letters, `/`, Ctrl, and Alt are never a pad key. A desktop's keyboard, while the terminal has focus, sends more, each under the same guards
// and rate: typed text (`{text, stream}`), one raw write of at most 64 printable characters, so no Enter, Escape, or escape sequence rides
// along and Enter still comes alone and probed; a paste (`{paste, stream}`), up to 4,000 characters with line breaks and tabs but no other
// control character, inside the bracketed-paste markers so pi takes it as one paste and a line break submits nothing; Delete; and Ctrl or
// Alt chords (COMBOS) as Herdr names them. Ctrl+Z never goes (pi would stop in the background, where nothing here brings it back), Ctrl+D
// asks first (it leaves pi on an empty editor), and so does a second Ctrl+C within a second (pi leaves on the second). The composer's Edit sends pi's dequeue key (`dequeue`: Alt+Up, Alt+Q on Windows and WSL, or the user's own binding, which the session's bridge names, dequeuekey.ts), under the guard (a paired device's too: no link_request open) and the rate and with no mirror, as typing needs none. Stop (`{keys: ["esc"]}`, the composer's) needs no mirror. Herdr 0.9 has no
// names for Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down: those go as the fixed sequences pi reads (pane.send_text writes them raw), and only they.
