// Ending what a controller started (docs/specs/2026-11-05-link-shared-box.md, section 3). A main an ally run opened for a device has the full rights of a main on peer text, and it outlives the run that opened it. When
// that device leaves the team, or no longer has `dispatch`, the box asks the main to quit, as `boss_close_main` does (the main decides: it refuses while a turn runs, a subagent works, or a dialog is open, and the
// sweep asks again), and tells the team's admins. It acts on a device it has found short of `dispatch` in two sweeps in a row, so one bad read of the policy file or the roster ends nothing. A main opened below `dispatch` (with the boss's Allow for that one call) is not a controller's work and is left alone. An ally run needs none of this: the server
// already ends it when its sender leaves the roster or loses `dispatch` (runs.ts, the watcher's tick).
