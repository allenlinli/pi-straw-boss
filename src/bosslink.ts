// remove | rotate`; the first of `link status` and `link decide` are bossopen.ts's). Like bosspaths.ts each posts to the route the page posts to (`link/confirm-answer`, `dialog-answer`, `invite`, `invite-text`, `invite-cancel`,
// `join-start`, `join-project`, `join-cancel`, `create`, `leave`, `trust`, `role`, `remove`, `rotate`), so the holder keeps every check (the digest, the device, the level, the folder, the relay); this side parses the line, shows the whole question in pi, and asks hereOnly (hereOnlyOpts) before
// anything that lets a teammate's tower run a call, answers for an unattended box, or changes who may command this computer. They are the boss's typed input only: boss.ts refuses them in a tower run or an ally run,
// control.ts keeps a paired device's composer from typing them, and no tool reaches this module. Two things here are secrets: the relay's token goes from a masked screen (secretscreen.ts) into the request and nowhere else
// (pi's `ctx.ui.input` echoes it), and an invite's text is drawn on a screen of its own, never as a notice. Whatever a teammate's device wrote (arguments, questions, labels) is shown with control and bidi characters as
// escapes, so it cannot repaint what the boss approves.
