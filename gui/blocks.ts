// The page's drawing of pi-better-show's blocks (docs/specs/2026-11-07-better-show-host.md), a lazy chunk (blockschunk.ts): the text is split by the package's parser, prose is the page's own Markdown (markdown.ts), each block is the
// element of its kind fed with the block's data (never markup: the elements build text nodes), and a block that does not parse shows its source in code. An element's answer is handed to the host, which delivers it and only then locks the
// element with the fields that went (`answered`); a refusal leaves it open with the reason under it. While an answer is on its way every drawing of the block is locked (inert, "Sending…"): a redraw does not find it open. What a block can name is the host's to
// resolve: an image only through `image`, and a page, a diagram, or a link target never. What goes out under the boss's name is what the boss saw: a chip is drawn as its text, and a form or checklist whose names are not its labels (a choice's value, a question's or an
// item's name) shows the exact outgoing text first, in a confirm step of its own, and sends that very text only when the boss presses Send. A `tree` is a display block of text only: a name is a text node, and a note's links are shown as their text, since a snapshot an agent wrote offers the page no link and no route.
