// this computer started again with every block open. The record is the server's now: one owned file (the caller's `save`, mode 600), read by every device. An answer is `pending` from the moment the server begins to send it and `done` with the fields
// that went once the owner took it; a block that is either is never begun again. Bounded (`max` entries, each field list cut) and pruned (`keepMs`; a pending entry never confirmed within `pendingMs` was not delivered, or was and told its page so).
// Nothing here reopens a block silently: a file that cannot be written refuses to begin, so nothing is sent; one that cannot be written after the send keeps the entry in memory and says so. A file that cannot be read (a link, another account's, not JSON, an entry out of the schema) starts the
// record empty and says so for the life of the process; the first write sets that file aside (`aside`) instead of replacing it, and the note stays, so no block answered before is taken for open without a word.
