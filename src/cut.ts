// Whether a restored subagent's session ends mid-turn, read from the jsonl pi keeps for it, and what to tell the child then.
//
// pi writes an assistant message when the model has finished it, before its tool calls run, and each tool result when the tool returns. A Herdr restart or a reboot in between leaves the
// transcript ending in an assistant tool call with no result (`call`), in a result the model never read (`result`), in a message nobody answered (`prompt`: a user message, or a custom
// message that starts a turn, such as an intercom message or a monitor's wake), or in a reply that was being written when the process died (`stream`). The restored pi waits at its prompt and does nothing of its own, so the child has to be
// told to go on. An assistant message that stopped for any other reason ended its turn: an abort is the boss's own stop, a stop or a length limit is an end, and an error is no cut unless its message
// is the one a restart leaves (claude-bridge's Claude Code process terminated by SIGHUP, or exited with code 129; a SIGTERM or code 143 is a kill by hand as well, and nothing here shows a restart came after it, so it is no cut). A turn that stands at a question (ask_user_question,
// caller_ping, an intercom ask) is waiting, not cut. Only `message` entries and the custom messages that start a turn count; a custom entry or a model change says nothing of the turn.
