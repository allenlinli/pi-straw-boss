// What an operate session may ask of the box's GUI (docs/specs/2026-11-07-link-operate.md §6.3, §7): the table below is the whole of it, in one place. A request that matches no row is refused. What a row allows then
// runs control.ts, with every guard of a paired device's request (`remote`); what the table refuses never reaches it. Decisions 5 to 9 and 12 make this stricter than remote mode: no shell lines, no /boss commands, no
// bare panes, no spawning or closing of bases, no documents.
//   `path` is the part of the URL after /api/, with `*` for one segment, `a|b` for either, and a closing `**` for any rest. First match wins.
//   `cross`: `request` is a page request answered here, `watch` and `mirror` and `snap` are the stream's own entries (gui.operate), `local` stays on the controller, `refused` is never answered.
//   `box`: only a session whose scope holds the box part (the `box` grant): the tower is the box's, not a team's (§4).
//   `names`: where the unit the request acts on is named, and so which keys the scope must hold.
