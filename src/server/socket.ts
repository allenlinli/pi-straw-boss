// so neither the name nor a file mode protects it. The secret is 32 random bytes in hex, made new at each server start and written to a file only its owner reads. It never
// crosses the wire: the two sides prove they know it to each other (protocol 2). The client sends `hello { v, nonce }`; the server answers a nonce of its own and an HMAC of both
// nonces under a label for the server; the client checks that, and only then sends `auth { proof }` (an HMAC under a label for the client) and its request; the server acts only
// once that proof checks, and then answers the hello's facts. Both proofs are compared in constant time, and a connection that does not follow this is closed with no answer.
