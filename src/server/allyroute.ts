// What an ally run leaves with the server for the device it serves (docs/specs/2026-10-26-sb-backend.md, Ally runs; RV6-F003). A local session an ally run writes to, or opens, is answering a peer's request, and what it
// says back must never reach a local run: it would carry the peer's words, with no context, into the run the boss trusts. So these live apart from the local run's expectations and ledger, per device:
//   `ally-routes.json`   the sessions an ally run waits on (a `tower_reply` that expects a reply, one answer) or opened (every report), and for which device,
//   `ally-answers.json`  what those sessions said, kept until the device's next ally run takes it (the same rule as a link message: a message that arrives during a run waits for the next one),
//   `ally-opened.json`   the opener's ledger of the mains ally runs opened.
// An `expect` route and an answer live 24 hours, as the local files; an `opened` route lives 7 days after the main's last report and is bounded and dropped with its main (below). This file has no pi dependency: it runs in the server's bundle.
