# Straw Link: operating an unattended box from a controller

Status: built and documented (task 9, 2026-11-08; batch review fixes at the end of §11.8), live check (task 10) not done. On `main`: R1 and R2 (straw-relay), tasks 1 to 8 and the wiring (§11.6); they shipped in 0.62.0 except the controller's page (task 7, §11.7), which is in 0.64.0 (not yet released). Task P landed in moldplan-center (MR !81, compared with §13 in §11.8). The docs are `docs/how-it-works.md` (Straw Link operate), `docs/unattended-device.md` §2, §7 and §8, the Message kinds table and Relay section of the Straw Link spec, and row 10 of the shared-box spec. The one fresh reviewer over the whole change-set that row 9 asks for before release, and whether the relay with R1 and R2 is deployed, are not recorded here. Boss ruling 2026-11-07 (ask_user): all sixteen recommendations of section 12 taken, including the five places stricter than remote mode (decisions 5 to 9 and 12: no `!` lines, no `/boss` commands, no `hereOnly` choices, no answer panes, no opening of bases or mains and no closing of a base, shelf documents by name only), decision 2 (`box` scope only for the box's own units) and decision 15 (the relay's `live` class; R1 may ship alone, each relay deploy after a tower go). Todo #121. Base `main` 95df290 (0.61.0, untagged). Request relayed by 無人塔台規劃 (01a1a17a-c765) from the boss's ask_user answers. A boss addendum of 11/07 (via sb 主塔台實體化) sets the bar: 「基本上就和我們一般遠端模式完全一樣」. It follows [2026-11-05-link-shared-box.md](2026-11-05-link-shared-box.md) and [2026-11-07-link-remote-stop.md](2026-11-07-link-remote-stop.md). Section 12 lists the open decisions. Each one has options and a recommendation.

## 1. The request and the bar

The boss: 「無人塔臺不好控制的話不容易工作，包括終端機和對話內容」. The box is agent-tower-01: `herdr.service` and `straw-boss.service`, user units of `agent`. The controller is the boss's Mac.

1. **Live view and input** on the box's Herdr panes: the tower, and every main and worker. That covers the terminal screen and the conversation, typing, Escape and interrupt, and steering. **No arbitrary shell** (the boss rejected one).
2. **Who.** Team admins only, through a grant above `dispatch`. hq-signed grants stay dispatch-only. 「如果我同事建立他的團隊，也要能用」: the admin of any team the box serves, scoped to that team's units.
3. **History.** Live panes, and the pi session transcripts of finished runs on the box, readable from the controller.
4. **Acceptance bar (addendum).** The box's sessions behave in the controller's GUI exactly as local ones do under `/boss gui remote`:
   - the map: bases, tabs, the ⋯ menus, Dismiss;
   - the comms view: the full transcript and the input box;
   - queued messages, todos and monitors;
   - Zen items and waits.

   The box is shown as one more base, and it is reachable from the boss's paired phone through the Mac's GUI. The boss declined an interim `tailscale serve` of the box's own GUI, because it is a new inbound path on the box. The Link E2E channel is the only route.
5. **Constraints.**
   - E2E end to end: no plaintext at the relay, and no new relay-side content storage.
   - The box's root-owned `policy.json` decides who may operate.
   - Revoke, leave, or admin removal ends open operate streams at once.
   - Every attach and every input is logged in `link.log`: who, pane, when, and never the content.
   - A dispatch-only member sees nothing new.

**Design in one line.** A **remote base bridge**, not a bespoke viewer. The box's sb server runs its own GUI core for one operator session, under that operator's scope. The controller's sb server shows the result as bases of its own net. Page requests on those bases cross the link as sealed request and reply frames, and stream events cross back as sealed frames. The page itself barely changes (§8).

## 2. What the code has, and what it lacks

What the code has:

| Piece | Where | Reused for |
|---|---|---|
| The page's whole data surface: one SSE stream (`hello`, the net snapshot on every change, `problem`, `ping`, `view`, `mirror`, `history`, `cards`), the GETs `api/history` and `api/entry` (paged, `PAGE` 150, `limit` ≤ 300) and `api/image`, and the POSTs under `api/*` | `src/gui.ts:157-285`, `src/watch.ts`, `src/control.ts` | Everything that crosses. §6 lists it route by route. |
| The **remote** guards a paired device meets: `localOnlyText` (`BOSS_LOCAL`, `BOSS_LINK_LOCAL`); Escape-only while a `link_request` or a `/boss gui lan` face is open; a `hereOnly` choice, and a cancel of an all-hereOnly dialog, refused; a secret `value` refused from every page; `server`, `remote`, `lan` and most `link` routes refused | `src/control.ts:194-205`, `:239-248`, `:337-343`, `:390-399` | The box runs every operate request with `remote = true`. Operate adds more refusals (§7). Nothing is loosened. |
| The key pad: one key at a time, 8 a second per session, mirror freshness (3 s), the Enter probe and its confirms, Ctrl+Z never, Ctrl+D and a second Ctrl+C confirmed, typed text ≤ 64 characters, a paste ≤ 4,000 | `src/keys.ts` | The same function on the box. |
| The terminal mirror: polls `pane.read`, sends the rows that changed, at 250 ms while the screen moves and 1 s otherwise, with every row on attach, after a resize, and every 10 s. It sends `hidden` while a `secret_drop` is open, keeps SGR only, and allows at most 2 terminals per stream and 6 per server. | `src/mirror.ts` | The box's reader. The bridge paces its frames for the link (§5.4). |
| The session reader: an index in memory, items read by offset, previews capped at 2 KB | `src/history.ts`, `src/items.ts` | Live comms, and the transcripts of finished runs (§9). |
| Who started what: an ally run's record (`device`, `team`, `level`, the session file; the last 50 per workspace), the `opened` route rows (`device`, `team`, `pane`, `level`), the pane token `sb_opened_by=link:<device>` on a main's tab, and `dispatcherOf` | `src/server/towerrunstore.ts:14-25`, `src/server/allyroute.ts:22-60`, `src/server/dispatcher.ts` | The operate scope of a unit (§4). |
| Signed and sealed envelopes; X25519 key records in the roster; `seal` as the HKDF and ChaCha20-Poly1305 pattern | `src/link/envelope.ts`, `src/link/crypto.ts` | The session handshake (§5.2). |
| `caps` gating, with features expiring after 2 h | `src/link/holder.ts:163`, `:909` | `operate/1`. |
| The box's own GUI: guihost starts it whenever the sb server runs, on loopback | `src/server/guihost.ts:228` | The bridge calls it in process, not over HTTP (§6.1). |

What it lacks:

- **A carrier for interactive traffic.** The relay knows two classes of kind (`straw-relay/internal/store/store.go:342-400`):
  - **Queued** kinds are stored until acked, for up to 7 days. They post one at a time in `seq` order through the team's outbox, so a frame stream would block the box's notices and replies behind it, and each post writes the `seq` to disk.
  - **Ephemeral** kinds are also stored (in SQLite, `expires` = 7 days). The relay keeps the last one per `(team, sender, kind)`, so a later envelope **to another addressee replaces it**.

  Neither class meets "no new relay-side content storage" for screens and transcripts. Neither carries two operators' streams without them overwriting each other.
- **Rate.** The relay allows 600 envelopes a minute **per team** (`internal/server/server.go:56`). That budget is shared by every device of the team, and typing alone could spend it (§5.5).
- **Confidentiality from team members.** Every envelope is under the team key, and the Non-goals of the Straw Link spec say any member can read any message. A relay that hands a frame to a curious dispatch-only member would show it the box's screen. That breaks "a dispatch-only member sees nothing new".
- **A grant above `dispatch`.** The policy carries `unattended`, `trust` and `teams`. The grants sync accepts only `dispatch` (`agent-tower-grants-sync.py:278`) and only the levels `reply`, `forward` and `dispatch` in the base (`:65`, `:470`).
- **A team for every unit.** On the real box both teams bind the same project, `/srv/work` (moldplan-center `group_vars/agent_towers/core.yml:67-80`). A unit's team cannot come from the folder it works in (decision 3).
- **A list of finished runs.** The net shows sessions for 10 minutes after they end (`RECENT_MS`), and a tower's last runs while their files are known. No list reaches back further.

### 2.1 A gap found while designing (not part of operate)

`unit-status` is per controller: its `report` is the last `tower_send` text to that very controller (shared-box spec, row 10), and its `mains` follow the controller since the remote stop. It travels as an ephemeral kind, and the relay replaces the stored copy per `(sender, kind)`, whatever its `to` says. With two controllers, the box's pass posts A's status and then B's, and B's deletes A's. A stream that reads at once still gets A's (`hub.notify`), but a controller that reconnects only gets the status addressed to the last controller of the pass. So on a box with several controllers, all but one see "no status lately" after a reconnect until a pass happens to end with them.

**Fix:** the relay keys ephemeral replacement by `(sender, kind, to)`. It is task R1 of §11, and it can ship on its own before operate.

## 3. Who may operate (the grant and the check)

### 3.1 The policy grant

A new **root-owned** policy field. Section 13 gives the exact shape, and decision 1 weighs it against a new trust level:

```json
"operate": { "<device id>": "team" | "box" }
```

- **`team`.** The device may operate the units of every team it is a **roster admin** of, and nothing else.
- **`box`.** The same, plus the box's own units, which no team owns: the box's tower service and its local runs, a session someone opened at the box itself, and a worker in a tab of its own (§4). This is the box owner's grant: the boss's Mac.
- **Prerequisites.** The device is also at `dispatch` in `trust`. A device listed in `operate` but not at `dispatch` is not granted.
- **Validation.** A malformed `operate` turns operate off for the whole box, logged once as `policy-operate-refused`, and leaves the rest of the policy in force. The rest still refuses as today. This fails closed for the new power without taking down dispatch.
- **Grants.** The hq grants document cannot carry `operate`: its format is closed (`DOC_KEYS`, `GRANT_KEYS`). The grants sync copies `operate` from the base policy unchanged (`build_policy` already does `dict(base)`). The base validation must still accept it and check its shape (§13).

### 3.2 The check, made at the box on every request

1. This device is unattended, and its policy reads as unattended now. A refused or unreadable policy ends every operate session (§5.6).
2. The sender is a current, attended member of the team the envelope came on.
3. The sender is at `dispatch` in `trust` now, and `operate` names it with `team` or `box`.
4. The unit the request names is in the session's scope (§4): the team the session was opened on, or the box part. For the team part, the sender is an admin of that team in the roster now (`holder.isAdmin`). An admin of team X has no reach into team Y's units (g346-F001).

A refusal answers with a reason word (`not-granted`, `not-admin`, `out-of-scope`, `local-only`, `policy`) and is logged (§10). The session itself is admitted at open by checks 1 to 3, and the scope (the open's team, box part) is computed then. Every request rechecks all four, against the roster and the policy at that moment.

## 4. Whose unit is it: the operate scope

A unit belongs to a team only through the box's own records of who started it. The real box has two teams on `/srv/work`, so the folder cannot decide (decision 3).

| Unit on the box | Owner | Read from |
|---|---|---|
| An ally run, live or finished | The run's `team` | The run record (`towerrunstore.ts`), keyed `ally-<run>`. A live ally pane is also matched by pane id, as in `dispatcherOf`. |
| A main an ally run opened | The `opened` route row's `team` | The row's `to` (session id), only when the pane token `sb_opened_by=link:<device>` names the row's device. Two witnesses, as in `refuseTarget`. A disagreement makes the main nobody's. |
| A member or subagent pane in the tab of such a main | That main's team | Its tab, as `dispatcherOf` reads it today |
| The box's tower service, its standing pane, its local and event runs | The box | Not a team's: the tower serves every team bound to the workspace |
| A worker in a tab of its own, a session opened at the box, anything else | The box | Not attributed (the residual of the shared-box spec, §2) |

- The scope of a session is the team its `open` came on, when the operator admins it and the policy names it, plus the box's own units when the session holds `box` and asked for them. An admin of two teams has two sessions, one per team (§5.6), each reaching its own team: a team's units and traffic ride only that team's session. A `box` grant's session covers the box's own units plus that one team, so a `box` operator that admins two teams holds two sessions that both show the box's units. The controller (task 6) dedupes a box-own unit that appears in two sessions by its key.
- The box filters its net down to that set before anything leaves it (§6.2).
- A unit seen once is written to the ledger with its owner (§9). A finished run keeps the owner it had when it ran, even after its route row or run record ages out.

**Residual.** The box's units run as one Unix account, and the pane token is Herdr state any process of that account can write. As in the shared-box spec, this decides whom the box shows a unit to over the link. It is no wall between two devs who both hold a shell on the box.

## 5. Transport

### 5.1 A third class of kind at the relay: `live`

- **Delivery.** The relay keeps a `live` envelope in memory only, and only long enough to write it to the addressee's streams that are open now. It never writes the envelope to SQLite. An addressee with no open stream does not get it (the post answers `delivered: 0`).
- **Stream event.** The SSE event is `live`, with **no `id:` line**, so it never moves `Last-Event-ID`. A resumed stream replays nothing live.
- **Per-stream buffer.** Each stream has a bounded queue: 64 envelopes or 4 MB. On overflow the relay drops the oldest entries and counts them. The next delivered envelope carries `dropped: n` in its event data, which the receiver uses as a resync hint.
- **Ordering.** Envelopes from one sender to one addressee are written in arrival order.
- **Checks.** The relay checks a `live` envelope as it checks an ephemeral one: signature, membership, the kind's rules, `seq` = 0, and `to` naming exactly one member that is not the sender. Its limits are its own (§5.5).
- **Relay logs.** Team, sender, addressee count, size and status, as now. Never bodies.

**The `operate` kind.** One new kind: `{ ephemeral: true, wholeTeam: false, sender: "any", live: true }`. `KindRule` gains `live` in both repositories, and in the `kinds` cases of `tests/link/vectors.json`. Both directions use it. The holder checks direction by the roster's `attended` flag: an attended sender may send only `open`, `frame` and `close` (a `req` is an inner message, §5.3, carried in a `frame`); an unattended sender only `accept`, `refuse`, `frame` and `close`. A wrong direction is dropped and logged. The receiver checks its own role as well: an `open` is for the unattended box and an `accept` or `refuse` for the attended controller, and the holder drops the others.

**On the receiver.** A live envelope is delivered now, so the holder drops one whose `ts` is older than 60 s (`stale-live`), one that names other than a single addressee (`operate-addressees`), and an `operate` that arrives as a stored `envelope` event (`live-on-stored-path`, dropped unopened). The post side fails closed too: an answer without `delivered` means the relay stored the envelope, and `sendLive` stops posting for an hour (`operate-relay-not-live`). The envelope checks are those of an ephemeral kind, including "`ts` newer than the last one from `from` for this kind". So the sender keeps a strictly rising `ts` for `operate`, at least +1 ms per envelope, like `unitTs`. Nothing is acknowledged.

**Why not reuse what is there.**
- Queued envelopes are stored for 7 days and block the outbox.
- Ephemeral envelopes are stored for 7 days and replaced per sender, which overwrites one operator's frames with another's (§2.1).

Both break the constraint. Decision 15 records the choice.

### 5.2 The session: a key only the two ends hold

Outer plaintext of `operate`, a canonical structure: `v` (1), `session` (16 random bytes), `type`, `body`.

| `type` | Sender | `body` |
|---|---|---|
| `open` | Controller | `eph` (X25519 public key, 32 bytes), `caps` (list), `want` (`team` or `box`) |
| `accept` | Box | `eph` (32 bytes), `scope` (the team ids admitted, and whether the box part is in), `limits` (mirrors, watches, budget) |
| `refuse` | Box | A reason word |
| `frame` | Either | `ctr` (8-byte integer), `ct` (AEAD ciphertext) |
| `close` | Either | A reason word |

- **Keys.** `k = HKDF-SHA256(X25519(ephOp, ephBox), salt = empty, info = "straw-link/operate/1" ‖ team ‖ session ‖ operator device id ‖ box device id ‖ ephOp ‖ ephBox)`, 64 bytes. The first 32 key operator → box; the last 32 key box → operator.
- **Frames.** ChaCha20-Poly1305. The nonce is a 4-byte direction tag followed by the 8-byte `ctr`. The AAD is `session ‖ ctr`. `ctr` starts at 1 and rises by 1, and a receiver drops any `ctr` not above the last one it took.
- **Binding.** `open` and `accept` are signed envelopes, so each ephemeral key is bound to a device. `accept` also carries `sha256(open body)`, so the box's signature covers the operator's key too. The relay cannot sit in the middle. A team member who holds the team key reads only the outer layer: a session id and two public keys.
- **Forward secrecy.** The ephemeral private keys never leave memory and are dropped at close, so neither a later team-key leak nor a device-key leak opens a recorded session.
- **Replay.** A replayed `open` within the freshness window (`ts` no older than 60 s) yields a session whose key needs the operator's ephemeral private key, which the relay does not have. The box refuses a session id it has seen, and holds at most 2 open sessions per operator device per team and 6 in all, so a replay costs at most one refused slot.
- **Rekey.** A session lasts at most 12 hours. The controller then opens a new one, and the page sees nothing of it but one fresh snapshot.

Vectors: the key derivation, a frame's AEAD with the nonce and AAD layout, and the outer structure cases, in `tests/link/vectors.json` (`operateCases`). The relay replays only the structure cases.

### 5.3 Inner messages

The inner messages are JSON compressed with `deflateRaw` (Node's built-in zlib; still no runtime dependency) and sealed in `frame`.

| `t` | Direction | Fields | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `snap` | Box → operator | `net` (the sliced net, §6.2) | On change, at most one per 2 s, and one at once after `accept` |
| `watch` | Operator → box | `id`, `target` (a box key, or `w:<ws>`), `on` | Start or stop the box's `watchSession` or `watchWorkspace` |
| `ev` | Box → operator | `id` (a watch id, or `m:<key>` for a mirror), `e` (the event name), `d` | A stream event the page knows (`history`, `cards`, `mirror`) |
| `req` | Operator → box | `id`, `m` (GET or POST), `parts`, `q`, `body` (JSON, or the bytes of an upload as base64) | One page request on a box unit (§6.3) |
| `rep` | Box → operator | `id`, `status`, `body` | Its answer |
| `part` | Either | `of` (the message id), `i`, `n`, `bytes` | A message over 160 KB, in parts. Reassembly caps: 4 MB per message and 8 MB per session; a part missing after 10 s drops the message. |
| `ping` | Either | — | Every 15 s. No frame for 45 s ends the session on either side. |

### 5.4 Pacing on the box

- **The mirror.** The box's reader polls as it does locally. The bridge sends **whole visible screens**, never row diffs, at most 2 a second while the screen changes. When the screen is calm it sends an empty "current" frame every 2 s, so the controller's 3 s freshness holds through a slow link. A dropped frame then costs nothing: the next one is whole. A whole 120 × 40 screen with SGR compresses to a few KB.
- **Snapshots** are whole and deflated, at most one per 2 s.
- **History.** The first page (150 items with 2 KB previews, ≤ 300 KB raw) goes in parts. Appends are small.
- **The send budget.** One budget per box covers all operate sessions (§5.5). When it runs short the box stretches the mirror cadence first, to 1 s and then 2 s, then the snapshot cadence. It never drops a `rep`, `accept`, `refuse` or `close`, which queue ahead of everything.

### 5.5 Budget: bandwidth, rate and latency against the relay's limits

Peak per operator session (one page with the map, one comms view and one terminal):

| Stream | Envelopes/min | Bytes/min (deflated, before base64) |
|---|---|---|
| Snapshot on change | ≤ 30 | ≤ 450 KB (5 to 15 KB each) |
| Mirror, screen moving | ≤ 120 | ≤ 720 KB (≈ 6 KB each) |
| History appends | ≈ 10 | ≈ 20 KB |
| Pings, both ways | 8 | ≈ 3 KB |
| Typing: requests + replies, the controller coalescing typed text into ≤ 64-character runs and capping the pad at 4 requests/s per session | ≤ 480 while typing hard | ≈ 100 KB |
| **Peak total** | **≈ 650** | **≈ 1.3 MB** |
| First page of a comms view | 2 to 4 parts once | ≤ 300 KB raw, ≈ 80 KB deflated |

- **The relay's limits.** Today's 600 envelopes a minute is **per team**, shared with all queued traffic. A single operator typing hard at the box would push the team into 429s. The relay therefore gives `live` its own limiter (decision 15):
  - 1,200 envelopes and 8 MB a minute per `(team, sender)`;
  - 3,000 envelopes a minute per team;
  - the queued 600 a minute untouched.

  A `live` over its limit is refused with 429 and **not retried**. The box's own budget stays below it: 900 a minute across its sessions.
- **The envelope cap.** 256 KB stays. Parts are ≤ 160 KB, under that cap with room for the envelope.
- **Storage.** Nothing is added. `live` is never stored, so the team's 50 MB cap is untouched.
- **Latency.** These are estimates, measured in the live check (§11, task 10):
  - keystroke to echo: controller → relay → box, then the Herdr write, the next mirror read (≤ 250 ms), and box → relay → controller. About 0.6 s at p50, at most 1.5 s at p95 is the acceptance line.
  - snapshot staleness: at most 2 s, plus one relay hop.
  - a request's answer: one round trip, about 0.3 s. The controller gives up after 20 s with 504 "the box did not answer; check before sending again", as for a Herdr timeout.

### 5.6 Lifecycle and teardown

- **Open.** The controller's sb server holds one operate session per `(box, team)` while **any** GUI page stream is connected and the box's fresh `caps` list `operate/1`. That covers the Mac's page and every paired phone (decision 13). It closes the session 60 s after the last page stream leaves.
- **Refusals.** A `refuse` is remembered for 10 minutes for that box and team. The page then shows nothing new, which is what a dispatch-only member sees.
- **Reachability.** No frame for 45 s marks the remote bases `unreachable` (the page greys them, as a stale ally card) and reopens the session.
- **The box ends a session at once:** it sends `close` with a reason, stops the session's watches and mirrors, and drops its keys. It does so on:
  - **a roster change**, checked in `onRoster` right after `takeEntries`: the operator removed, no longer an admin of a team in the scope (that team leaves the scope; the session closes when the scope is empty), or the box removed;
  - **a policy change**, from `fs.watch` on `/etc/straw-link/policy.json` and its folder plus a 2 s poll of its stat (inode, size, mtime), re-read on any change: the operator gone from `operate`, below `dispatch`, or a policy that reads as refused or unattended no more;
  - **any request whose recheck (§3.2) fails.** The request is refused, and the session closes when the failure is the grant, not the unit.

  Unlike the revoker's two-look rule (shared-box spec, row 14), **one** bad read ends operate. Ending a view loses no work, and a session that outlives its grant is the one failure that must not happen.
- **On the controller.** The holder stopping a team (removal, fork, leave, a team dropped from the config) closes its sessions locally at once.
- **"At once"** means within the next 2 s poll for a policy edit, and when the roster event arrives for a removal or a role change.

## 6. The bridge

### 6.1 Box side: an in-process operate entry to its own GUI

`startGui` gains a transport-free entry, `gui.operate`. The bridge never calls the box's HTTP listeners, so no token, cookie or CSRF is involved, and nothing new listens on the box.

- `snapshot(scope)`: the net, sliced (§6.2).
- `watch(target, send)`: the same `watchSession` and `watchWorkspace`, with `send` going to the session.
- `mirror(key, on, send)`: `mirrors.toggle` on a synthetic stream id per operate session (`mirrors.open`), so the limit of 2 terminals per stream applies to the session and the 6 per server to the box.
- `request(method, parts, query, body, scope)`: the same routing as an HTTP request, after the operate refusals of §7. It runs `control` with `remote = true`, and the `api` GETs (`history`, `entry`, `image`).

The refactor is to split `handle` in `control.ts` so that its body takes `(parts, json, flags)`, while the HTTP shell keeps the origin, content-type, CSRF and body checks. One routing path then serves both, and a fix to a guard reaches operate without a second copy.

### 6.2 What the box shows: the sliced net

`sliceNet(net, scope)` keeps only units in scope (§4). A base whose tower is the box's own and not in scope keeps its in-scope tabs and units, with `tower: null`. It drops:

- `link`: the box's own allies, alerts, confirms and units;
- `stashed`;
- `trust`;
- `head`: the box's head tower is box-wide;
- `events` of units out of scope;
- every Shelf document's capability (`cap`). Decision 12: names only: the cards keep `display`, `kind`, `reason`, `revision`, `onScreen` and `docsCut`, and nothing serves a document. Task 6 validates the lengths of `display` and `reason`.
- Also (review round): a base's mark is recomputed from what is left; a team scope sees its own live ally runs on a stub tower that holds nothing else of the tower.

Operate input rules added by the review round (OR-F001 to F003): the composer's text goes only into an empty editor (any draft refuses it, `draft`); Enter on any `/` draft is refused (`command`, since the command menu's completion may turn `/b` into `/boss`); pad chords come from an explicit editor-only list (`OPERATE_COMBOS`: cursor and word moves, kills, yank, one Ctrl+C, Alt+Enter probed), so Ctrl+G and every other pi app action is refused (`chord`); a second Ctrl+C or Escape within a second is refused (`leaves-editor`); keys go only while pi is the pane's foreground program. Watches and mirrors keep their scope and end when their unit leaves it (`rescope`, and after each reading). Entry and image replies over 1 MB are bounded on the box.

Session files and paths never leave (they are not in the snapshot today either).

### 6.3 Routes: what crosses, what stays local on the box

The box's routes, by the scope's units only. **Crosses** means the page action on a box unit works as on a local unit under remote mode.

| Route or event | Operate | Note |

### 6.4 Controller side: remote bases

- **Merging.** The controller's net reading merges each live session's `snap` into `bases`, one base per box workspace in scope. Each base carries a `box` field: `{ device, short, label, team, scope, can, state: "live" | "unreachable" | "ended", why? }`. `can` lists the page actions §6.3 lets through, so the page hides the ⋯ entries it may not use.
- **Keys and ids.** The controller rewrites every key and base id to `x<16 hex of sha256(box ‖ tag ‖ box key)>` (no team in it, §11.3; a tab's also holds its base) and keeps a table back to the box's key. The page's routes stay plain and URL-safe (a subagent key on the box can hold a slash and free text), and no box key reaches a URL.
- **Routing.** `control.ts` asks `bridge.owns(key)` first: for a session key, a `close/*` or `dismiss` body key, a `tower/<ws>` id, an `api` GET key, and the `events?watch=` target. An owned key goes to the bridge, which sends `req` or `watch` and maps the `rep` back.
  - Controller-side guards still run first for a paired phone: `localOnlyText` and the rest. The box runs them again, so a phone through the Mac meets them twice.
  - The pad's freshness precondition is checked against the forwarded frames on the page's own stream, within 5 s for a remote mirror.
  - Several pages on the controller share one box watch or mirror for a key, fanned out locally.
- **Untrusted box data.** A malicious or compromised box sends this data, so the controller's bridge validates it against a strict schema before any page sees it:
  - known fields only;
  - lengths and character sets as the box's own net produces them;
  - marks and roles from their enums;
  - images only as `image/png|jpeg|gif|webp` data URLs under 1 MB;
  - `then` in an answer's reply limited to `terminal` and `run` (never `pane`);
  - a reply's `status` a number in 200 to 599 and its body under 1 MB.

  Anything else is dropped and counted (`operate-bad-frame` in the controller's link.log). Item text is already rendered as untrusted model text by the page (markdown.ts), and stays that way.
- **One card per dialog.** A box dialog then reaches the controller twice: as the forwarded card (`dialog-open`), and as the remote unit's `pending`. While a remote base for that box is live, the forwarded card of the same `(device, dialog id)` is not shown. The remote unit's own pending is shown and answered through operate. The box takes the first answer either way.

## 7. Input safety

Every operate request runs as a paired device's would (`remote = true`), with all its guards. On top of that the box refuses, and it decides this from its own state, never from the request:

1. **Shell lines** (decision 5): an `input` whose text starts with `!` (after leading blanks), and an Enter whose editor probe reports a `!` line. The probe gains a `shell` flag beside its `command` class; an older bridge cannot be on the box, which runs one build.
2. **`/boss` commands** (decision 6): any `input` text matching `^\s*/boss(\s|$)`, and an Enter whose probe reads such a line. `/boss send` and `/boss open` on the box can reach another team's sessions, and the box's own settings.
3. **Bare panes, spawning, base close, trust, link, server, head and documents**, as the table of §6.3 says.
4. **`hereOnly`** stays unanswerable by operate (decision 7). The box's "here" is a person at its own console. A deny, where some choice is not hereOnly, may be given.
5. **A secret** is never typed or read: `value` is refused, and the mirror stays `hidden` while `secret_drop` is open, as today.

6. **Which key is which, and who holds the terminal** (re-review of task 4, RR-F001 to RR-F005). A user's `keybindings.json` can put any app action on a key the pad sends (a chord, Tab, an arrow), and Herdr keeps labelling the pane `pi` while an external editor that pi started runs below it. So before every operate key write:
   - (a) the key's effective binding in the box's running pi must be confirmed an editor action. The session's bridge, inside pi, reads pi's live keybinding manager (`src/bindings.ts`) and reports with every flagged probe, as pi itself decides it, by the bytes the pad sends (`manager.matches(bytes, id)`, so `esc`, `escape` and `ctrl+[`, or `enter`, `return` and `ctrl+m`, are one key): `keys`, the pad keys (as Herdr names them) that any action outside a short allow-list holds (`tui.editor.*`, `tui.input.*` apart from submit, `tui.select.*`, `tui.altScreen.*`, Shift+Tab's thinking cycle, the tree, model and session-picker dialogs' keys); `holds`, the pad keys that hold each of submit, follow-up, clear and interrupt; and `raw` (see (b)). The box refuses a key in `keys` (`why: "binding"`). Submit and follow-up are local only on Enter and Alt+Enter, which are probed for the draft, clear only on Ctrl+C and interrupt only on Escape, whose double presses are counted; on any other pad key they are refused (`why: "binding"`), since there nothing guards them. A key id in `keybindings.json` that pi does not define (an extension's shortcut, such as `mcp.panel.open`) is taken as foreign, so its keys are in `keys`. A probe with no report (an older bridge, a pi whose app actions the manager does not hold, no answer, a report with a part missing) refuses every key (`why: "binding-unread"`). The check runs for every key, Escape and Stop included, and for Enter and Alt+Enter on the same probe as the draft's check.
   - (b) pi must hold the pane's terminal. Two looks, neither enough alone. `raw`: pi's own `process.stdin.isRaw`, which pi-tui's `stop()` clears before it hands the terminal to `$EDITOR` or suspends on Ctrl+Z; the box refuses every write whose probe does not say `raw: true` (`why: "terminal"`), typed text, paste, composer input and dequeue included (each probes for it). And `pane.process_info` must list exactly one `pi` (`why: "foreground"`); other programs beside it are no reason to refuse, since pi's helper children (claude-bridge's `claude`, stdio MCP servers, build tools) share its process group and a stock session has some. Both are looked at inside the control job, as the last awaits before each write: the process list, then `raw` once more from the bridge (an extra, cheap probe per write). The list catches a program that takes pi's place in the foreground or a second pi, not one that sits beside pi: an `$EDITOR` pi starts shares pi's process group, so the list reads `[pi, vim]` and passes it. For that case `raw` is the guard, which is why it is read again right before the write and not only with the earlier binding probe, which may be a second old. A Windows pane, whose list shows the shell alone, has no `pi` in it and refuses, as the spec's Windows non-goal already said.
   - Escape: under operate a second Escape within 1 s of the last is refused whatever Herdr's `agent_status` says (the status lags an abort), and `confirmed: "double-esc"` is never honoured: one Escape goes at most.
   - A watch or mirror begun while `rescope()` narrows the scope ends with the narrower scope: the session counts its rescopes, and an entry that was being set up re-reads the latest one after its wait (a mirror already attached is detached again).

Everything else in pi stays reachable. Typing into a main is driving a pi session at full rights, so an operator can still ask the model to run anything its hooks and the box's sandbox allow. That is no more than `dispatch` gives today. What operate adds is the view (screens and transcripts) and steering without a model run in between. §10 records this as the residual.

## 8. The controller's page

- **Placement.** A remote base shows on the map like a local base, with a device badge ("agent-tower-01") and the team's name. In Standard and Geek it sits after the local bases and before the ally cards. The ally card of that box (`gui/allyunits.ts`) stays for a box with no live session, and is folded under the base when one is live.
- **What works on it.** The comms view, the composer, the terminal tile and card, the key pad, queued messages, todos, monitors and Dismiss are the same components fed by the merged net. The ⋯ menu hides what `box.can` does not list.
- **States.** `unreachable` greys the base with "last seen …". `ended` replaces it with one line naming the reason: 「操作權限已撤銷」, or 「這台機器不讓這部裝置操作」 for a refusal shown once. Strings go in the paraglide messages, in both languages.
- **History.** A fold, "Earlier runs (n)", under the remote base, filled from `api/transcripts`. A row opens the existing read-only comms view, as a tower's `localRuns` key does.
- **Zen.** The box's waits and questions are items like local ones, from the merged net. Nothing in Zen is specific to the box.
- **Phone.** Nothing new. The phone pairs with the Mac, and the Mac's bridge carries it.
- **Pi.** No operate viewer in pi (decision 14). `/boss link operate` lists the live sessions (box, team, scope, since, pages) and `/boss link operate off` ends them all on this computer and keeps operate off until `/boss link operate on`, also across a GUI and a server that start again (the wiring review, OW-F003). They are slash commands only (D23), and none is a tool.

## 9. History: transcripts of finished runs

- **The ledger.** The box's server keeps `link/operate-ledger.jsonl`, mode 600 and append-only. A unit attributed in a net reading writes one line the first time it is seen, and one when it ends:
  - `id` (16 hex of a hash of the session file path);
  - `team`, or `box`;
  - the dispatcher device;
  - role, scrubbed unit name and workspace label;
  - the session file path (the box keeps it; it never leaves);
  - `first`, `last`.

  It holds no content. It keeps 30 days and at most 2,000 rows, compacted at start.
- **Listing.** `GET api/transcripts?before=&limit≤50` (operate only) answers the finished runs in the session's scope, newest first, whose file still exists: `id`, name, role, workspace, dispatcher label, first, last, size. A run the box's net shows live is not one (its row is open): a main that restarted resumes the same session file, so its run from before the restart is the live main's own, not an earlier run (§11.10).
- **Reading.** `api/history` and `api/entry` take `t<id>` keys. The box resolves the id in the ledger, never a path from the request, checks the scope again, and reads the file through `history.ts`: the same paging, `limit` ≤ 300, 2 KB previews, and the one-entry fetch at 1 MB.
- **Redaction** (decision 10): none beyond today's. A transcript holds what the unit saw, and pattern scrubbing would give a false sense of safety. The grant is admin-only and scoped for this reason. Images are kept as the reader gives them.

## 10. Audit and threat model

**`link.log` on the box.** These lines go in the holder's log through `store.log`, never with text, keys, choices, or file content:

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `operate-open` | team, from, session, want, verdict (`accepted`, or the refusal word) |
| `operate-open-throttled` | team, from, dropped (the opens of one sender on one team that a refusal's 10 s window dropped; §11.4) |
| `operate-close` | team, from, session, by (`box` or `operator`), reason, seconds open |
| `operate-watch`, `operate-mirror` | session, from, unit (the box key), pane, on/off |
| `operate-input` | session, from, team, unit, pane, action (`input`, `keys`, `answer`, `dequeue`, `upload`, `close-unit`, `close-tab`, `dismiss`, `memory`, `tower`), class (`text`, `paste`, `pad`, `chord`, `enter`, `esc`, or none), status |
| `operate-read` | session, from, unit, what (`history`, `entry`, `image`, `transcripts`) |
| `operate-refused` | session, from, route, reason |

`link.log` of an unattended box rotates at 8 MiB and keeps four old copies, `link.log.1` (newest) to `.4` (decision 16, `LinkStore` `unattended` and `AUDIT_LOG` in `store.ts`; the server and the tower runtime give their store the policy's answer, asked only once the log is over the attended 1 MiB). An attended computer keeps 1 MiB and one old copy. An hour of typing would otherwise push a week of audit out.

**Threats.**

| Threat | What it gets | Held by |
|---|---|---|
| A compromised admin device with `operate` | Everything its scope's units show: screens, transcripts, dialogs; and their input | The admin-only grant from the root-owned policy, the scope, the audit, and instant removal from `operate` or the roster. Code execution is what `dispatch` already gives. Shell lines and `/boss` are refused, so the remaining path runs through pi and its hooks. |
| A dispatch-only member, alone or with the relay | The outer layer: session ids and ephemeral public keys | The frames are under a key only the two ends derive. `open` from a device not granted is refused before any data. |
| A malicious relay | Drops, delays, replays and reorders | The AEAD counter drops replays and reordering. Drops cost a resync (whole frames, whole snapshots). A replayed `open` cannot be driven. Nothing is stored to leak later. |
| A malicious box | Feeds the controller's page | Strict schema validation (§6.4). No documents. `then.pane` stripped. Replies capped. The box cannot make the controller send anything, since the controller only forwards its own pages' requests. |
| A stolen paired phone | Operate through the Mac | As for every remote-mode action: unpair on the Mac. The box refuses `/boss` and shell lines anyway. |
| A stale grant | A session after a revoke | Single-read teardown, the policy watch, and a recheck on every request (§5.6) |
| Two holders during a takeover | Duplicate sessions | Sessions live in the holder's memory. A new holder has none, and the controller reopens after 45 s of silence. |

**Residual** (documented, not guarded):
- the one Unix account (§4);
- a pi session driven at full rights can do what the box lets the agent user do (§7);
- typed text crosses the relay sealed but reaches the box's pane in clear, as a local typist's would;
- a shortcut an extension hard-codes, and the modal keys of a custom editor (`setEditorComponent`), which nothing the bridge reads lists (§11.5). A shortcut a user binds in `keybindings.json` is caught (taken as foreign).

## 11. Tasks

Every task is red first, and its anchor is `npm run check && npm test` plus its files through `npm run test:one`. Relay tasks use `go test ./...` in straw-relay. GUI key tests also run with a Linux `navigator.platform`, and the post-merge set includes `tests/imports.test.ts`.

| # | Task | Repository and files | Red tests | Depends on | Fresh review |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| R1 | Ephemeral replacement keyed by `(sender, kind, to)`: the §2.1 fix | straw-relay `internal/store/store.go`, `EventsAfter` | Two addressees both get their own last status after a reconnect | none | Yes, with R2 |
| 1 | Wire: `live` in `KindRule`, the `operate` kind and its outer structure, vectors (`kinds`, `operateCases`, key derivation, AEAD), the SSE `live` event in `sse.ts`, a `postLive` path in `relay.ts` and the holder (serial per team, rising `ts`), caps `operate/1` | `src/link/kinds.ts`, `sse.ts`, `relay.ts`, `holder.ts`, `tests/link/vectors.json` | `tests/link-operate-wire.test.ts` | none | Yes (shared contract) |
| R2 | The relay's `live` class: no storage, a bounded per-stream queue, `dropped`, no `id:`, its own limiter; the `operate` kind; testdata pointer to task 1's vectors | straw-relay `internal/link/kinds.go`, `internal/server/envelopes.go`, `events.go`, `server.go` | Live never in SQLite (row count 0); not delivered to non-addressees or an offline device; order kept; overflow counted; a resume replays no live; limiter separate from the 600/min | 1's vectors | Yes |
| 2 | The session core: open, accept, refuse, close, key derivation, counters, parts, deflate, pings and timeouts, as a pure module over a fake transport | new `src/link/operate.ts` | `tests/link-operate-session.test.ts` (fake clock): replay and reorder dropped, wrong direction, a part missing, 45 s silence, the rekey at 12 h, vectors | 1 | Yes (crypto) |
| 3 | The grant, scope and teardown on the box: `operate` in `policy.ts` (fails closed for operate only), the §4 scope resolver, the §3.2 check, the policy watch and roster hook | `src/link/policy.ts`, new `src/server/operatescope.ts`, `holder.ts` (`onRoster`) | `tests/link-operate-authority.test.ts` (every refusal word, admin of another team, both teams on one project), `tests/operate-scope.test.ts` (each row of §4, two witnesses disagreeing), `tests/operate-teardown.test.ts` (policy edit within 2 s, refused policy, admin demoted, removed member; one bad read ends) | 1 | Yes (authorization) |
| 4 | The box's GUI seam: `gui.operate`, the split of `control.ts` `handle`, `sliceNet`, the §7 refusals (the probe's `shell` flag), the §6.3 table as one routing table with its own test | `src/gui.ts`, `src/control.ts`, `src/keys.ts`, `src/probe.ts` and its bridge half, new `src/operateroutes.ts` | `tests/operate-routes.test.ts` (table: every route allowed or refused, with remote guards kept), `tests/operate-slice.test.ts`, `tests/operate-input.test.ts` (`!` typed, pasted then Enter, `/boss`, hereOnly, `value`) | 1 | Yes (input safety) |
| 5 | The box's bridge: holder sink, sessions, pacing and budget, link.log lines | new `src/server/operatebox.ts`, `towers.ts` wiring | `tests/server-operate-box.test.ts` (server world: sliced snapshot, mirror at ≤ 2/s with whole frames, budget stretches the mirror first, every input logged without text) | 2, 3, 4 | With 6 |
| 6 | The controller's bridge: sessions while pages are connected, merge and key rewrite, routing in `control.ts` and the GETs and watch, strict validation, dialog dedupe, `unreachable` and `ended` | new `src/server/operatehost.ts`, `src/gui.ts`, `src/control.ts`, `src/net.ts` | `tests/operate-controller.test.ts`, `tests/operate-sanitize.test.ts` (hostile payloads: unknown fields, a key with `/..`, a script in a label, `then.pane`, a huge image, a 2 MB reply) | 2, 4's snapshot shape | Yes (a malicious box) |
| 7 | The page: the remote base badge, `can`, the states, the "Earlier runs" fold, strings, demo states | `gui/*`, messages | Model tests for the base, `can` and states; `visual-tester` for Standard, Geek, Zen and the phone width | 6 | No (anchor + visual check) |
| 8 | Transcripts: the ledger, `api/transcripts`, `t<id>` keys | `src/server/operateledger.ts`, `src/watch.ts` | `tests/operate-transcripts.test.ts` (scope, a file gone, 30-day compaction, a path never taken from the request) | 3, 4 | With 4 |
| P | The policy on the box (owned by 無人塔台規劃) | moldplan-center `agent_tower` role: `policy.json.j2` (`operate` from a new `agent_tower_operate` variable), `agent-tower-grants-sync.py` (`load_base` validates `operate`; `build_policy` keeps it; the fail-closed fallback has none), `tests/infra/test_agent_tower_grants_sync.py` | A grant document never adds `operate`; a malformed base `operate` is refused; the fallback has no `operate` | Shape fixed by §13 | That repository's own review |
| 9 | Docs and release | `docs/how-it-works.md`, `docs/unattended-device.md` (§2 policy, §7, §8), the Message kinds table and Relay section of the Straw Link spec, row 10 of the shared-box spec; release a minor (0.62.0) | — | 1 to 8 | One fresh reviewer over the whole change-set before release (AGENTS.md: wire, authorization, security) |
| 10 | Live check on agent-tower-01 | After R1, R2 are redeployed (the boss's go: moldplan-center cloud), 0.62.0 is on the box, and P has landed | The acceptance list of §14; latency measured | all | — |

Order: R1 can land alone. Task 1 and R2 go together, with the vectors first in this repository. Tasks 2, 3 and 4 run in parallel worktrees from task 1's commit. Task 5 follows 2, 3 and 4. Task 6 follows 2 and the snapshot shape of 4. Tasks 7 and 8 follow. Each relay task needs a relay redeploy, and so the boss's go.

### 11.1 Notes carried from the task 1 review

**What straw-relay R2 must enforce** (the client assumes each point):

1. `operate` enters `Kinds` together with the live class, in one commit. The rule is `{Ephemeral: true, WholeTeam: false, Sender: any, Live: true}`; `KindRule` gains `Live`, and `TestEnvelopeShapeVectors` compares it with the vectors' `rule.live`. There is never a commit where `operate` is a plain stored ephemeral kind: such a relay stores sealed frames for 7 days and replaces one operator's frames with another's. Copy `tests/link/vectors.json` from the commit that merges task 1, and update the commit line in `testdata/README.md`. The receive case "an operate from alice is taken" then passes through `CheckEnvelope`.
2. Never stored: no `PutEnvelope` for `Live`. Test: the SQLite row count for kind `operate` is 0 during and after delivery, and it is not in `EventsAfter` or on a resume.
3. The post answer is `{id, delivered}` (201, `delivered` a non-negative integer, `id` 32 lowercase hex). The client refuses any other shape. No `duplicate` through the store.
4. The SSE event is `event: live` with no `id:` line. Its `data` is `{id` (hex32, equal to the header id), `from` (equal to the header from), `ephemeral: true`, `envelope` (base64url without padding), `dropped?}`. `dropped` is omitted or a non-negative safe integer, carried on the next delivered envelope after an overflow. The client turns anything else into a `malformed` event that it never acknowledges.
5. Exactly one addressee, a member and not the sender. A `to` with 0 or more than one id, or a non-member, is refused with 422. Today's `postEnvelope` silently drops non-member ids and fans out to the rest.
6. Its own limiter, decided after the decode. The 600/min team limiter runs before the decode today (`s.limiter.allow` precedes `DecodeEnvelope`), so peek the kind first or split the path: a live post must not spend the queued budget. Limits as §5.5: 1,200 envelopes and 8 MB per (team, sender) per minute, 3,000 per team per minute; 429 `rate-limited`, which the client does not retry.
7. The per-stream queue: 64 envelopes or 4 MB, drop oldest, count into `dropped`. Order per sender and addressee is kept; the client posts serially per team and assumes arrival order equals send order.
8. The same checks as an ephemeral kind (signature, membership, epoch, head, `seq` 0, `ts` window), with no store-based staleness or replacement for `Live`. The client's `ts` rises per (sender, kind) across all addressees.
9. An unknown kind on an old relay stays `422 unknown-kind`: the client backs off an hour on that code, and again on a new stream.
10. Logs: team, sender, addressee count, size, status; never a body.
11. Removing a member stops live delivery to it at once: its streams end, as today for queued kinds.

**For task 2 (the session core).**
- The session object owns its send counter. Nothing outside it calls `operateSeal` with a caller-chosen `ctr`: `operateSeal` is stateless, so a repeated `(key, dir, ctr)` is a ChaCha20-Poly1305 nonce reuse. It never resumes a counter across a reopen: a fresh `operateEphemeral()` per `open`, keys dropped at close (§5.6's reopen after 45 s).
- `operateKeys` throws a raw OpenSSL error for a low-order peer key (all-zero, 1, the order-8 points). The session catches it and refuses the `open` or `accept`; it never lets it reach the stream handler. (No call site exists in task 1, so no test is added there.)
- `accept.limits` are unbounded integers on the wire. Task 6 clamps them (a malicious box).

**Built in `src/link/operate.ts` (task 2).** The core owns no timer: the host calls `session.tick()` about once a second (`OPERATE_LIMITS.tickMs`), and a session reads a clock and writes to a `send` it is given. Where the spec left a number or a rule open, the core takes:
- **Ping:** one frame when nothing was sent for 15 s (any frame is a sign of life, so traffic is a ping's work). Silence is no frame that opens for 45 s, counted from the accept; a junk frame that does not open moves nothing. Either end then sends a best-effort `close` and ends (`silence`).
- **Open:** an `open` nobody answers within 20 s ends as `no-answer` (a late accept finds the box told by the `close`).
- **Rekey:** both ends end at 12 h by their own clock (`rekey`, a `close` word). The operator counts from its `open`, which always comes before the box's `accept`, and the box ends 60 s later (`rekeyGraceMs`), so the controller's own `rekey` comes first and the box sees its `close` as `peer-closed`; the host reopens at once. The base never greys.
- **Clocks:** a session and the registry read `now` through `steady`, which turns a step back into no time passed (a wall clock stepping back would else stop the pings for the length of the step, and hold a dead session for as long). A step forward still counts.
- **Parts:** a deflated message over 160 KB is cut in parts of at most 120 KB, each its own frame with contiguous counters. A message's 10 s runs from the last part that arrived. Caps: 4 MB per message (also the inflate limit of any frame), 8 MB and 16 messages in flight per session, at most 64 parts per message. A lying part (changed `n`, repeated or out-of-range `i`, a nested part) drops its message.
- **The counter:** a received `ctr` has to be above the last one that opened; gaps are fine and a reorder loses the late frame. Only an opened frame moves it.
- **The registry:** `OperateRegistry` is the box's book for §5.2's Replay rule (a seen session id, 2 per operator device per team, 6 per box). The host passes it to `OperateSession.accept`, which admits, sends the `refuse` with the registry's word when it says no, gives the slot back when the key derivation fails, and makes a session that releases its slot when it ends: the host calls neither `admit` nor `release`, so no failure path can leak a slot. An id is remembered while its session is open and for 120 s after the admit and after the release: the holder's 60 s freshness window plus 60 s of a fast sender clock (the stale-live check lets a `ts` up to 10 min ahead pass, so a replay of an old `open` is held off by the strictly rising `ts` of the live session, not by the 120 s alone). `refuseOpen` is the one-line `refuse`.
- **A failed send** goes to `onTransportError` and does not end the session; the host decides (the silence timer ends a dead link). A handler that throws is swallowed. `onEnd`, `onDrop` and `onInner` must not throw: the host's timer wraps `tick()` and the holder's sink catches `receive`.
- **Test seam:** the fixed ephemeral key and session id of the vectors go in under a symbol key (`TEST_ENTROPY`) of the `open` and `accept` options, not in the deps; a test scans `src/` so that only `operate.ts` names it.

**For task 5 (the box's bridge).**
- `live()` and `sendLive()` each call `loadTeam`: a synchronous file read and a full roster replay with signature checks, about 0.6 ms for an 8-entry log, on every frame in both directions, at about 10 to 20 envelopes per second per session. Cache the replayed roster per head.
- `liveChain` has no cap: a stalled relay holds each send for up to `timeoutMs` while a producer that does not await piles up tasks. Pass an `AbortSignal` or a 5 s deadline to `postLive` (a late live frame is worth nothing) and bound the pending sends by the §5.4 budget.
- The sink must not throw an error that carries content: `operate-sink-failed` logs `String(error)`, and §10 says no text in link.log.

### 11.2 Notes from task 3 (the grant, scope and teardown as built)

**Files.** `src/link/policy.ts` (`operate`, `operateRefused`, `operateIdle`, `createOperateNotes`, `policyStamp`, `watchPolicy`), `src/server/operatescope.ts` (`ownerOf`, `admitOperate`, `checkOperate`, `narrow`, `storeOwnerWorld`), `src/server/operateguard.ts` (`createOperateGuard`), `holder.ts` (`member`, the `onRoster` option), and `service.ts` (the once-only `policy-operate-refused` and `policy-operate-idle` lines).

- **Words and ends.** `admitOperate` and `checkOperate` give exactly the words of §3.2: `policy` (attended, refused, a malformed `operate`, or a team the policy does not name), `not-granted` (not an attended member of the team the session came on, no `operate` entry, below `dispatch`), `not-admin` (nothing to reach; a team that left the reach), `out-of-scope` (a unit of another team, a box unit without the box part, a key nobody owns), `local-only`. `local-only` is the route table's (task 4) to raise: the check takes `localOnly` and answers it last, so a unit out of reach learns nothing from it. A failure of the grant carries `ends` (`policy` or `roster`); a failure of the unit does not, unless the scope is empty then.
- **Scope.** At the open: the team the open came on when the device is an attended roster admin of it (one session per (box, team), §5.6; review OAR-F003 narrowed it from every team the device admins), and the box part only for a `box` grant that asked for it (`want: box`). A session whose grant is `box` needs no team. Afterwards the scope only narrows: `narrow` drops a team the device no longer admins and the box part once the grant is lowered, and a session with nothing left ends (`roster`, or `policy` when the lowered box part was all it had).
- **Owner.** `ownerOf` reads: an `ally-<run>` key by its run record (live or finished; a record without a team is the box's); a live ally pane by pane id; a main by the `opened` row and the tab's `sb_opened_by` token, which must name the row's device (the row may find the main by its session id or by the `pane` it kept); a member or subagent by its tab. Any disagreement, two panes of a tab naming two devices, a token that is no device id, a row with no team, or one witness alone: the box's. A key the registry does not know has no owner (`out-of-scope`).
- **Teardown.** `watchPolicy(onChange)` is `fs.watch` on the file and its folder plus a 2 s poll of `policyStamp` (inode, size, mtime, ctime, owner, group and mode of both, `gone:<code>` for a path that cannot be read); `onChange` runs on any event or changed stamp, and the guard rereads the policy once per sweep. `LinkHolder` calls `onRoster(team)` after the entries are stored (outside its lock), when a team stops (`kill`: the box removed, a fork; `leave`; a team dropped from the config by `refresh`), and for every team when the holder stops. `member(team, device)` answers `{ role, attended }` from the roster now, and nothing for a non-member, a team this holder does not run or has stopped, or a roster that cannot be read: one bad read ends. A hook that throws is logged by the error's name only (`operate-roster-hook-failed`).

**For task 5 (wiring).**
- Build the guard with `policy: () => readPolicy(policyDeps)`, `member: (t, d) => link.holder.member(t, d)`, `owner: (k) => ownerOf(storeOwnerWorld({...}), k)` (the registry's refs, Herdr's listing and the live ally panes at the moment of the request), and an `end` that sends the `close` (reason `policy` or `roster`), stops the session's watches and mirrors, and writes `operate-close` with `by: box`. The guard writes no `operate-*` line itself except `operate-policy-unreadable` and `operate-end-failed`.
- Start `watchPolicy(() => guard.onPolicy())` with the box's server and stop it with it; pass `onRoster: (team) => guard.onRoster(team)` in the holder's options. The holder is built before the guard needs to exist: hold the guard in a variable the closure reads.
- Every `check` rereads the policy and replays the roster (`member` is one `loadTeam` per team it asks about). At the rate of §5.5 that is cheap, but the roster replay is the cost that task 1's note about caching per head applies to as well.
- The caps of the box list `operate/1` only when the guard exists, as `operate` in the holder's options says, and only while the box's policy has an `operate` grant (`operateOn`, §11.6 OW-F002).
- **Bind the request to the session (review OAR-F006).** `guard.check(id, { from, team, unit?, localOnly? })` takes the envelope's sender and team and answers `not-granted` (ending nothing) when they differ from the session's own. The session layer passes them from the verified envelope, never from the inner message, so a member who learned a session id cannot ride another device's grant.
- **The hook on every holder.** `createLinkService` builds a fresh `LinkHolder` on each gain (service.ts), and `onRoster` is not yet in `ServiceOptions`: add it there and pass it to every holder the service builds. `member` reads the current `link.holder` and answers nothing when there is none.
- **`end` never waits on `store.withLock`.** `onRoster` runs inside the holder's lock from `kill` (in `takeEntries`) and from `displaced` to `stop`; a queued `sendLive` is fine, a synchronous wait on the lock deadlocks.
- **Start order.** Start `watchPolicy` before the first `admit`: a change before that is caught only by the next request.
- **Duplicate ids.** `admit` throws on a session id already in use, and the id is remote-chosen: the session layer catches the throw and answers with a refusal.

### 11.3 Notes from task 6 (the controller's bridge as built)

**Files.** `src/server/operatehost.ts` (the host: sessions, merge, routing, watches, terminals), `src/server/operatesanitize.ts` (the schema every byte from a box passes), `gui.ts` (`operateHost` option: the merged net, the GETs, the stream's watch target and terminal streams, page counting), `control.ts` (`bridge` dep: the claim before any local route, and the guards of this end), `net.ts` (`Base.box`, `RemoteBox`), `guihost.ts` (passes `operateHost` through). Tests: `tests/operate-controller.test.ts`, `tests/operate-sanitize.test.ts`, with `tests/operate-host-world.ts` (the real session core on a fake box over a hand-pumped transport).

**Wiring (done by the wiring task, §11.6).** `createOperateHost({ now, device: () => holder.deviceId, boxes: () => offersOf(holder), send: (team, device, m) => holder.sendLive(team, device, m), log: store.log })`, handed to `createGuiHost({ operateHost })`; the GUI owns and stops it. The holder has one `operate` sink: on an attended device it goes to `host.receive(message)` (a message of an unattended sender; the host ignores `fromAttended`), and the holder lists `operate/1` in its caps only when that option is set, which a controller needs too (the box checks the controller's caps before it sends `accept`). A team that stops closes its sessions at once: call `host.closeTeam(team)` from the holder's `onRoster` hook when `holder.member(team, self)` answers nothing (it does for a stopped team). `/boss link operate` (D23, decision 14) is `host.status()` and `host.off()`; the slash command itself is not written.

**Where the spec left a number or a rule open, the host takes:**
- **Keys.** `x` + 16 hex of sha256(box ‖ tag ‖ box key), with no team in it (§6.4 names the team; §11.2 asks for dedupe by key across a box's sessions, and a team in the hash would make a box-own unit two units). A base id and a tab id have their own tags; a tab's includes its base. A request goes to a live session that shows the key, the box scope's first.
- **Scope asked.** Every `open` asks for `box`; the box narrows it to what the grant allows (`accept.scope`), and `can` and `scope` on the base say what it was.
- **Merged bases.** Bases with one box workspace id are one base across sessions: tabs united by id, units deduped by key within a tab, outside units and outposts by key and id; the tower of the box scope's session is the whole one, else the stubs' live ally runs are united; the mark is recomputed over the result.
- **Rewrites reach every field.** `successor`, `base`, a watch's `key`, an event's `ws`, a card's keys. A key seen only on a stream event is registered in a bounded table (5,000 per session).
- **Inner wire the host speaks (to the box).** `watch {id: "w<n>", target: <box key> | "w:<box workspace>", on}` (a page that joins a running watch asks again under the same id, so the box sends the first page again; the last page leaving sends `on: false`), `req {id: "r<n>", m, parts, q: {…}, body}` with the box's keys in `parts` and in the body's `key`, `workspace` and `tab`, an upload's bytes as base64 in `body`, and `q` as a record of at most 8 short strings. A terminal is `POST sessions/<box key>/mirror {on}` as a request; its frames come back as `ev` with id `m:<box key>`.
- **Box → controller.** `snap`, `ev` (`history`, `cards`, `mirror`) and `rep` are the only types it may send; anything else is `operate-bad-frame` (`type`). A `rep` or an `ev` for nothing waiting is dropped silently (it is late). A snapshot within 250 ms of the last is held for the next tick (a flood is read once a second).
- **Limits.** `accept.limits` are clamped (mirrors 6, watches 16, budget 900). The pad: 4 keys a second per unit and a frame on the page's stream in the last 5 s (Stop's Escape needs neither); a page shows at most 2 terminals; an upload is at most 2 MB. A request not answered in 20 s is a 504.
- **States.** `live` → `unreachable` after 45 s without a frame (the session's silence), reopening after 5 s, doubling to 5 minutes; a box that never answered (no snapshot yet) shows nothing. A close by the box for its policy or roster is `ended`, with the box's word if it is one of a known set (else `other`), shown as an otherwise empty base until the session reopens (retry after 60 s). A refusal is remembered 10 minutes; its one line shows for 60 s the first time for that (box, team) in this server's life and never again, so a dispatch-only member sees it once and then nothing (§1.5, §8). The 12 h rekey reopens at once and keeps the base and the terminals.
- **Review round (OHR-F001 to F014).** The watch stop names the box's own target the watch was started with (`group.raw`); a watch that moves to another session is stopped on the old one. The box's close words: `policy` and `roster` end the base (`ended`); `stopped` (its server stopped), `overload`, `unavailable` (GUI swapped) and any other word grey it and reopen with the backoff. Refusals: only a grant's refusal (`not-granted`, `not-admin`, `bad-key`, …) is remembered 10 minutes and shows its line; `unavailable`, `operator-limit`, `box-limit` and `seen` are "not now" and are retried with the reopen backoff with no line (a decision on §5.6's "a refuse is remembered for 10 minutes": it holds for the grant's words only). A session that ended for a host reason (`off`, `closeTeam`, `idle`, `stop`, `gone`) is forgotten, and the watches of pages that stay are asked again by the session that replaces it. A box that is no longer offered (removed, attended, no `operate/1`) is closed (`gone`) at the next tick and leaves the map. A greyed base stays in the net while its reopen is in flight. `accept.limits` are used: the host asks a session for no more watches or terminals than it says (a watch over the limit, or one the box refuses with status 400 or more, tells the page `history {state: "unknown"}` and is asked again after 10 s). `stop()` is final: the clock, `page()` and `tick()` do nothing afterwards. Stop's Escape is neither limited by nor counted in the pad's 4 a second. `operate-send-failed` is written once a minute per session, with a `count`. A box's `select.copy` is kept only when it equals the whole title the page shows, on one line (no CR, LF or tab): the button shows no text of its own and a title box scrolls (RR-F003). An HTTP upload sends `X-Sb-Name` in the query's `name`. Tests: `tests/operate-host-review.test.ts` (host and fake boxes), `tests/server-operate-host-wire.test.ts` (host against the real box bridge, with `tests/operate-box-world.ts`, task 5's test world, imported by both).
- **Re-review round (RR-F001 to F006).** The reopen wait (5 s doubling to 300 s) resets only after a session lived 60 s, not on every accept, so a box that accepts and closes `overload` is retried a handful of times in ten minutes. A 409 `superseded` answer to a watch is not a refusal (a later `on` of the same id answers for itself). A file name's query value may be 1100 encoded characters (120 CJK characters). Tests: `tests/operate-host-rr.test.ts`.
- **Wiring contract (OHR-F006; settled in §11.6).** Before the wiring, `service.ts` gave an `operate` sink only to an unattended device (`...(operate && !attended() ? { operate } : {})`) and `holder.ts` lists `operate/1` in `caps` only with a sink, while this section asks that the attended computer take the sink (`host.receive`) and list `operate/1`: a box sends `accept` only to a peer whose caps list it, and the attended holder drops every `refuse` and `frame` without a sink. The wiring commit gives `ServiceOptions` an attended sink for `operateHost.receive`, lets an attended holder's caps list `operate/1` (`offersOf` keeps only `unattended` devices, so the Mac never looks like a box), and makes §11.3 and §11.4 agree. Nothing constructed `createOperateHost` before the wiring.
- **Dialog dedupe.** The forwarded card `dialog/<device>/<id>` is dropped while a live remote unit of that device holds a pending answer with the same dialog id.
- **link.log (controller).** `operate-open`, `operate-close` (`by`, a reason word, seconds), `operate-send-failed` (the error's name and a count, once a minute per session), `operate-bad-frame` (`why`, `kind`, a count; ten lines per session, then every hundredth), never with text or keys.

**For the page (task 7).** A request for a key the box no longer shows (an `ended` session clears its table) falls through to the local routes and answers 404 "No such session". The `ended` base has no tabs and a `box.why` word. `Base.box.can` lists the page actions; `tower` is there only with the box scope. `GET api/transcripts` and `t<id>` keys are the ledger's (task 8): the controller side of them is a claim like `history`'s and is not written.

### 11.3 Notes from task 8 (transcripts as built)

**Files.** `src/server/operateledger.ts` (`openLedger`, `seenFrom`, `idOf`), `src/watch.ts` (`Transcripts` on the hub, `foundOf`, the `transcripts` list in `api`), and the `GET transcripts` row of `operateroutes.ts`.

- **Lines and rows.** A line is a row of `id`, `team` (`box` for the box's own), `device`, `role`, `name`, `workspace`, `file`, `first`, `last`, and `ended: true` on an end line. The ledger writes a line when a unit with a session file is first seen, one when it is missing from a reading (or shown not live), and one when a session it had ended is seen live again (a resumed session: `first` stays, the row is open again). `last` is the last time a reading saw it live and is kept in memory; the end line carries it, so a crash loses at most the tail of a run's time. The owner is fixed at the first line (§4: a finished run keeps the owner it had).
- **Compaction at start.** Lines fold into one row per `id`; rows whose `last` is over 30 days old go, then the newest 2,000 stay. The file is rewritten whole (`writeDurableText`, mode 600) only when something changed; a torn, foreign or id-mismatched line (the id must be the hash of the row's own `file`) is dropped. While running, the memory book is capped at 2,000 rows too, dropping the oldest finished.
- **No path from a request.** `api/history`, `api/entry` and `api/image` take `t<id>` (lowercase 16 hex, exactly). The ledger resolves it, the scope is checked again at that call, and `readable` demands that the row's file is, by its real path, a regular `.jsonl` inside pi's session folder (`sessionDir`): a symlink out, or a tampered ledger row, is not read. A key that is not `t<id>` falls to the registry as before.
- **Scope.** `within(() => Scope)` reads the scope at every call; a team session sees its team's rows only, `box` rows only with the box part. Not found (404), never a refusal word, for a row out of scope, so a key's existence is not told.
- **Listing.** `before` is the cursor `<last>:<id>` a page returned (`before` is absent on the last page); anything else is a 400. `limit` is 1 to 50 (default 50). A row whose file is gone is skipped and never counted in the page.
- **Real path, one handle (review OL-F001, OL-F003).** `.jsonl`, regular file and inside `sessionDir` are checked on the real path, never on the stored one, and `lookup` serves the real path. The check opens the file (no symlink at the last step, `O_NONBLOCK` so a pipe does not hang it), takes `fstat` of that handle (regular, `nlink` 1, so a hard link out of the folder is refused, same dev and inode as the real path) and closes it. The reader (history.ts) then opens the path again with `O_NOFOLLOW`; a swap of a folder in the path between the two steps is not closed (it needs write access inside pi's session folder, i.e. the user's own rights, and the read stays a `.jsonl` the reader can open). Accepted.
- **Owner after the row left memory (OL-F004).** The ledger keeps a compact index of the owner and device of every session it has read from the file or written, also after the 2,000 cap or the 30-day compaction dropped the row. A session seen again takes that owner, never the current one. A session whose line left the file at a compaction and is seen after a restart has no record and is owned as at a first sighting.
- **Keys (OL-F005).** A key of the form `t<id>` is looked up in the ledger alone (`watch.ts` `foundOf`): out of scope it is 404, never a registry lookup.
- **Chapters (OL-F006).** A handed-over run (several chapters) shows only its last session file in `api/history`: the ledger holds one row per session file and `lookup` returns no `chapters`. Known gap, not fixed here; a later task can chain the files of one run.
- **Mode.** The ledger file is set to 600 when opened (an append sets a mode only on create).
- **Wiring (done, §11.6).** Call `ledger.observe(seenFrom({...}))` on each net reading with the box's whole registry (the ledger needs the unfiltered reading, owners from `ownerOf`, devices from `dispatcherOf`, `live: false` for a net `ended` subagent), open it with `file: <stateDir>/link/operate-ledger.jsonl`, `root: sessionDir`, and the roster's label for `label`, and give each operate session's hub `transcripts: ledger.within(() => session.scope)`. The seam's `scoped` hub in `operateseam.ts` must pass `transcripts` through (it builds `{lookup, workspace, readers}` today); that file is another worker's, so task 8 stops at the hub's type.
- **Audit.** `operate-read` with `what: transcripts` is the bridge's to write (§10); the ledger logs nothing but a failed write (`failed`), which the server should report by error name only.

### 11.4 Notes from task 5 (the box's bridge as built)

**Files.** `src/server/operatebox.ts` (the bridge: sessions, pacing, budget, teardown, link.log lines), `src/server/operatewire.ts` (its wiring to the server's parts), and in `main.ts` the link service's `operate` sink and `onRoster` hook and the bridge's `stop` at shutdown. `service.ts` takes `operate` and `onRoster` in `ServiceOptions` (the box's sink goes only to the holders of an unattended device; an attended computer's holders take the controller's sink instead, §11.6; the hook goes to every holder) and shows `policyNow()` and `policyPath`. `guihost.ts` shows `operate()` (the GUI's operate entry and the registry's units while a GUI runs); `net.ts` gives `refs()`. `holder.ts`: a live post carries a 5 s deadline, and `operate-sink-failed` logs the error's name only.

- **One path in.** `take(OperateIn)`: an `open` makes a session; any other message goes to the session its id names, after the box checks that the envelope's team and sender are the session's own (`operate-drop wrong-sender` otherwise). The core checks the sender again.
- **Open.** The policy watch starts at the first `open` (before the first `admit` reads the policy), so an attended computer, which never gets an `open`, polls nothing. Then: `operate/1` in the open's caps (`unsupported`), `guard.admit` (a throw for a session id in use is `seen`), a GUI (`unavailable`), the registry (its own word: `seen`, `operator-limit`, `box-limit`, `bad-key`), then the seam session and one snapshot at once. Every refusal sends `refuse` with the word and writes `operate-open` with it as the verdict.
- **A request** (`req`) names a method, a path and a body. The route table's row says which unit it names (`names`); a row that stays on the box (`refused` or `local`, or no row) is checked with `localOnly`, so the answer is `local-only` for a unit in reach and `out-of-scope` for one that is not. The guard then checks the grant (and ends the session when it is gone), the scope is read again (`sync`), and the seam runs it under the session's scope. A seam refusal (`operate_refused`: `shell`, `boss-command`, `draft`, `chord`...) is logged as `operate-refused` with its word. At most 16 requests are in flight per session (429). A `watch` message is checked the same way and answered with a `rep` under the watch's id.
- **Ownership facts.** `guard.check` and `scope.has` read `owner` synchronously, so `refresh()` (Herdr's listing) runs before each check, before each snapshot, and every 2 s while a session lives; a listing that cannot be read (never read, or the last read failed) is dropped, not emptied and not kept (review OBX-F002): until a read succeeds a main, member or subagent is **nobody's**, so neither a team's scope nor the box part holds it, and a `box` session cannot reach another team's units through a Herdr failure. An ally run's key (its record) and a live ally pane (matched by pane id) need no listing and keep their team. The live ally panes and the registry are read at the moment of the call.
- **Scope narrowing.** After every guard entry (`onPolicy`, `onRoster`, `check`) and each pulse, a session whose guard scope changed gets `seam.rescope(newScope)` and a new snapshot. A `box` operator demoted from admin keeps the box part and loses the team part; the session ends only when nothing is left (or `roster`/`policy` as the guard says).
- **Pulse.** One timer of 250 ms runs while any session lives: it ticks each core, ends a session whose GUI is gone or was replaced (`unavailable`), flushes queued events, sends the mirror and the snapshot when due.
- **Pacing.** The mirror's frames (row diffs from `mirror.ts`) are folded into a whole screen per unit; a changed screen goes whole at most every 500 ms, a calm one gets an empty "current" frame every 2 s; `ended` goes at once; `hidden` follows the cadence. A snapshot is cut by the session's scope, sent at most once per 2 s, only when it differs from the last one sent, and at once after accept. Watch events go in order as they come, and 256 queued events end the session as `overload` (the controller reopens and starts again).
- **Budget** (`budget`, default 900 envelopes a minute across all sessions, counted over a 60 s window; the accept advertises it): the mirror cadence is 500 ms below 50 % used, 1 s from 50 %, 2 s from 75 %; the snapshot cadence is 2 s, and 4 s from 90 %; at 100 % no bulk (mirror, snapshot, event) goes until the window frees. `accept`, `refuse`, `close` and `rep` are never held, and a `refuse` is not counted against the budget (see the throttle below). Bulk also waits while 32 sends are in flight (a relay that does not answer), and at 256 nothing but a `close` or `refuse` is handed on, so the pending sends have a bound.
- **The throttle on refusals** (review OBX-F001). An `open` the box refuses (any word: not granted, not admin, policy, `unavailable`, or the registry's own) opens a 10 s window for its (team, sender), and the refusal is not counted in the budget. Further opens from that sender on that team inside the window are dropped before anything else: no `refuse`, no `operate-open` line, no policy read. The first open after the window (or `stop()`, which closes every window) writes one `operate-open-throttled` line (`team`, `from`, `dropped`) for what was dropped. A member without a grant can so neither spend the box's 900 envelopes a minute, nor spend its own relay allowance, nor push a real operator's audit out of link.log (§10, decision 16); the controller remembers a `refuse` for 10 minutes anyway (§5.6). Accepted opens are never throttled.
- **link.log** (§10): `operate-open`, `operate-open-throttled`, `operate-close` (by `box` or `operator`, the reason, the seconds open; the operator's word only when it is a short lowercase word), `operate-watch`, `operate-mirror`, `operate-input` (action, with `memory` for a tower's memory and `tower` for its other routes, read from the request's path; class `text|paste|pad|chord|enter|esc`, the unit, its pane, the reply's status), `operate-read`, `operate-refused`, plus `operate-drop`, `operate-overload`, `operate-snapshot-failed`, `operate-request-failed` and `operate-send-failed` (error names only). Never a typed text, a choice or file content: a test types a marker through every input route and greps every log line.
- **Teardown.** The guard's `end` calls `core.close(reason)` synchronously and the session is torn down in the same call (the seam session stopped, its mirrors and watches with it); nothing waits on the holder's lock. `stop()` closes every session with `stopped` and stops the policy watch, and sets a `stopped` flag (review OBX-F003): an `open` that the still-running holder delivers afterwards is refused (`unavailable`) without reading the policy or arming a watch or timer, and any other frame is dropped; `main.ts` builds no bridge once the server is leaving. A GUI that stopped under a session ends it `unavailable`.
- **For the ledger (task 8).** `BoxDeps.observe(net, scope)` is called with each session's sliced net right after it was read for a snapshot, before it is sent: the ledger's observer and a scoped hub that passes `transcripts: ledger.within(() => scope)` plug in there and in `gui.operate`; nothing here reads them.
- **Not done here.** The roster cache per head (note of task 1): `loadTeam` runs about 0.6 ms per frame and per `member` call; at the rates above that is about 1 to 2 % of one core, so it waits for a measurement. The `holder.log` line `operate-send-failed` is written at most once a minute per session.

### 11.5 Notes from the third review round of task 4 (RR3-F001 to F007)

- **Extension shortcuts need a pi API.** pi runs an extension's shortcut (`onExtensionShortcut`, the first line of the custom editor's `handleInput`) before every binding, and only refuses one on keys of its reserved list. Which keys the installed extensions take is known inside pi's extension runner (`getShortcuts(effectiveConfig)`), and no seam passes it on. Until pi core gives one, the bridge treats the ids of `keybindings.json` that pi does not define as foreign (`bindingReport`), which catches a shortcut a user binds there (pi-mcp-adapter does) and not one an extension hard-codes. The residual is listed in §10. The request to pi: an API that lists the effective extension shortcuts.
- **A custom editor** (`setEditorComponent`, a vim mode, say) shares the manager but has modal keys of its own that nothing here sees; the same residual.
- **Watches.** A request for a watch id that is superseded while it is set up (a second one for the same id, one asked off, `stop()`) does not register (409 `superseded`), so no watch lives outside the map `enforce` and `stop` walk.
## 12. Open decisions

| # | Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The form of the grant | (a) A separate root-owned field `operate: { device: "team" \| "box" }`, with `dispatch` in `trust` as a prerequisite. (b) A new level `operate` in `trust`, above `dispatch`. | **(a).** The 16 places in `src/` that name the literal `"dispatch"` stay as they are, and a grants document cannot carry it. With (b), each of those places changes, and so do the sync's `BASE_LEVELS` and the meaning of `true`. Missing one site would silently strip an operator of dispatch. |
| 2 | The box's own units (tower, local runs, sessions opened at the box, unattributed workers) | (a) The `box` value only (the box owner). (b) Every admin of every team. (c) Nobody. | **(a).** The tower serves both teams on `/srv/work`. An admin of one team should not steer what the other team's runs feed. The boss is the box owner. |
| 3 | What makes a unit a team's | (a) The records of who started it (§4). (b) The workspace's project. | **(a).** (b) cannot work on agent-tower-01: both teams bind `/srv/work`, so every unit would be shared or nobody's. |
| 4 | A worker in a tab of its own | (a) The box's (only `box` sees it). (b) Its main's team, through pi-herdr-agents' parent record. | **(a) now.** The parent record is the child's own claim. Revisit once the placement of workers on the Linux box is confirmed (unattended-device.md §5 already flags it). |
| 5 | `!` shell lines | (a) Refused from operate. (b) Allowed with the `command` confirm, as for a paired device. | **(a).** It is the direct route to "an arbitrary shell", which the boss rejected. This is the one place operate is stricter than remote mode. |
| 6 | `/boss` commands typed through operate | (a) All refused. (b) Only the paired device's `localOnlyText` list. | **(a).** `/boss send` and `/boss open` on the box reach other teams' sessions. |
| 7 | `hereOnly` choices on the box | (a) Never through operate. (b) Answerable by `box` scope. | **(a).** The box's here is its console. The approvals it guards change who commands the box. |
| 8 | Panes an answer opened (`panes/*`) | (a) Refused. (b) As remote mode. | **(a).** They run a shell. |
| 9 | Spawning and closing bases | (a) Refuse `open/*`, `dirs`, `close/base`, `close/stash`; allow `close/unit`, `close/tab` (all in scope) and `dismiss`. (b) Full remote-mode parity. | **(a).** A new main opened this way would have no route row, so it would belong to no team. A base holds the box's tower. Work still reaches the box by dispatch. |
| 10 | Transcripts' secrets | (a) No redaction beyond today (secret_drop hidden, `value` never). (b) Pattern scrubbing. | **(a).** Scrubbing is unreliable. The grant is admin-only for this reason. |
| 11 | Uploads (a pasted image into a box composer) | (a) Allowed, capped at 2 MB. (b) Refused in v1. | **(a).** It is part of the composer the boss uses. The cap keeps it within ~14 parts. |
| 12 | Shelf documents of box units | (a) Names only, never served. (b) Proxied. | **(a) for v1.** A box's HTML served from the controller's origin is the widest path for a hostile box into the page. |
| 13 | When a session opens | (a) Automatically while any page stream is connected. (b) Only when the boss opens the box's base. | **(a).** The bar is "one more base" on the map and in Zen, which needs the snapshot before anyone clicks. The cost is about 30 snapshots a minute at most while a page is open. |
| 14 | Pi's side (D23) | (a) `/boss link operate` status and `off` only. (b) A TUI viewer in pi. | **(a).** The addendum's bar is the GUI. A local kill switch in pi keeps the boss's control without a page. |
| 15 | The relay | (a) The `live` class, its own limiter, and R1. (b) The existing ephemeral class. | **(a).** (b) stores frames for 7 days and overwrites one operator's frames with another's. That is the constraint broken twice. (a) needs a relay release and a moldplan-center cloud redeploy, which needs the boss's go. |
| 16 | Audit retention | (a) Raise `link.log` rotation on an unattended box to 8 MiB × 4 copies. (b) A separate `operate.log`. (c) As is. | **(a).** The request names `link.log`. (c) loses a week of audit to an hour of typing. |

## 13. What the policy file needs

For 無人塔台規劃 (moldplan-center `agent_tower` role). This assumes decisions 1 and 2 take their recommendations.

```json
{
  "unattended": true,
  "trust": { "ibzkd5ijmtravej475kmrykvye": "dispatch", "<colleague's device>": "dispatch" },
  "teams": {
    "91347f343c0c58fcc29b39a5eb91cc9b": { "project": "/srv/work", "share": "status" },
    "f437518ed8510b36b0d7013e62c791c1": { "project": "/srv/work", "share": "status" }
  },
  "operate": { "ibzkd5ijmtravej475kmrykvye": "box", "<colleague's device>": "team" }
}
```

- **Shape.** `operate` is optional. It maps a 26-character device id to `"team"` or `"box"`, and nothing else.
- **Effect.** A device in `operate` must also be at `dispatch` in `trust`, or `operate` names it to no effect, logged once. The box grants `team` only for the teams the device is a roster admin of (§3).
- **Validation in pi-straw-boss.** An unknown value, a bad id, or a non-object turns operate off for the whole box (`policy-operate-refused`) and leaves the rest in force.
- **Ansible.** Write `operate` from a new inventory variable, `agent_tower_operate: { <device id>: team | box }`, default `{}`, into `policy.json.j2` as `{'unattended': true, 'trust': …, 'teams': …, 'operate': agent_tower_operate}`. Omit the key when the variable is empty.
- **The grants sync** (`agent-tower-grants-sync.py`):
  - `load_base` validates `operate` (ids, the two values, every id also in the base `trust` at `dispatch`), so the box's own check never meets a sync-written mismatch;
  - `build_policy` keeps it from the base as it is (it already copies the base with `dict(base)`);
  - a grants document can never add it (the format stays closed);
  - `EMPTY_POLICY`, the fail-closed fallback, has no `operate`.
- **A colleague's own team.** Add the team to `teams` and the colleague's device to `trust` at `dispatch` and to `operate` at `team`. The colleague, as that team's founder, is its admin. Nothing else is needed.
- **The box's device id** stays out of `operate` and `trust`, as the grants stage already asserts for `trust`.

## 14. Acceptance

**On the Mac's GUI**, and from the boss's paired phone through it, with the policy giving the Mac `box`:

1. agent-tower-01's workspaces are bases with their tabs, units, marks, queued messages, todos and monitors.
2. Zen shows its waits and questions.
3. A box main's comms view shows its whole transcript, and Send and follow-up reach it.
4. The terminal tile shows its live screen, and the pad's Escape interrupts it.
5. Dismiss and close of a unit work.
6. "Earlier runs" lists finished ally runs and opens their transcripts.
7. The echo latency is at most 1.5 s at p95.

**Refusals and limits:**

8. A device at `dispatch` without `operate` (or with `team` but not admin) sees no remote base for the box's other units. The box logs `operate-open` with `not-granted` or `out-of-scope`.
9. Removing the Mac from `operate` ends the base within 2 s ("ended: the operate grant was withdrawn"). The box logs `operate-close reason=policy`.
10. `!echo x`, `/boss send …`, a bare pane's keys, `open/main` and a `hereOnly` choice through operate are refused, each with a logged `operate-refused`.
11. The relay's SQLite has no row of kind `operate` during or after a session.
12. A marker string typed through operate is in no log on the box or the relay.
13. Two controllers each keep their own `unit-status` across a reconnect (R1).

### 11.6 Notes from the wiring (todo #121, the server's start)

**Files.** `src/server/main.ts` (the host, the controller sink, the roster hook, the stop), `src/link/service.ts` (`operateSink`, `controller`, the `operate` and `operate-off` names of the GUI's link requests), `src/server/operatewire.ts` (`operateRecord`: the ledger, its observer and the sessions' transcripts), `src/server/operatebox.ts` (`transcripts` dep, the guard's unit check for `t<id>` reads), `src/operateseam.ts` (`open(sink, transcripts)`), `src/server/operatehost.ts` and `operatesanitize.ts` (the transcripts list), `src/server/guihost.ts` (`operateHost` is a factory), `src/link/holder.ts` (caps again for a late peer), `src/bosslink.ts` and `src/control.ts` (`/boss link operate`). Tests: `tests/server-operate-wiring.test.ts` (two real servers in one world over the fake relay: a Mac with a page over HTTP, and a box), `tests/operate-wiring.test.ts` (one test per wire), `tests/boss-link-paths.test.ts`.

- **One sink per holder, by role.** `ServiceOptions.controller` (`receive`, `status`, `offSince`, `off`, `on`) and `operate` (the box's `take`) are both given by main.ts; `operateSink(attended, …)` picks one when a holder is built: the controller's on an attended device, the box's on an unattended one, none where the option is absent (a secondary server). So an attended holder lists `operate/1` and takes `accept`, `refuse` and frames (OHR-F006), and an unattended one never has a controller end: `boxes()` of the host is empty unless `link.attended()`. The sink is read when the holder is built (as `attended()` already was).
- **The host is one per GUI.** A GUI stops the host it was given (`halt`), and a stopped host is final, so `createGuiHost({ operateHost })` takes a factory and each `startGui` asks for a new one; main.ts keeps the current one for the sink, the roster hook and `/boss link operate`. It runs a clock only while a page of a primary server is connected, a link holder runs here and the device is attended (`enabled`; a computer with no Link or an unattended one ticks nothing and reads no policy, OW-F008), and opens nothing without an offer. The host object itself is built with the GUI, whether or not Link is on: it is a few empty maps with no timer. The server's shutdown stops it before the link holder (each session says `close` while the holder still runs; the GUI's own later stop is a no-op).
- **A team that stops.** The holder's `onRoster` hook closes the host's sessions of a team when `holder.member(team, self)` answers nothing (a stopped team, a removed device, a roster that cannot be read). `kill` marks the run dead before it calls the hook, and `sendLive` refuses a dead run, so the `close` of such a session is not sent: the box ends it by its own roster check when it was the controller's removal, and by its 45 s of silence otherwise. The Mac's side is closed at once (`operate-close`, `by: controller`, `team-stopped`).
- **`caps` reach a peer that starts late or restarts (found by the e2e; reworked by OW-F001).** A device's `caps` are ephemeral: the relay gives the last one of each sender to a stream that connects, but only past the Last-Event-ID the stream resumes from, and any queued envelope after the peer's last `caps` (a dispatch, a tower's reply) has moved that cursor past it. A holder that restarts quickly (a pi-straw-boss update, `/boss server restart`, a takeover) starts with an empty memory of its peers' caps and meets none of them again until their next hourly `caps`; a box then cannot send `accept` (`sendLive` refuses a peer without `operate/1`) and a controller offers no box. So **the first `caps` a holder posts after it started lists the word `hello`** (one more entry of `features`, so a build that does not know it reads a list it ignores; it is no feature of its sender and `capsFor` never shows it). A holder that reads a `hello` from another device marks its own `caps` due, and they go at the next tick that the 15 s minimum spacing (`capsMinMs`) allows, without the word. Two devices therefore answer each other at most once, five hellos in a minute cause one answer, and a relay or another member can ask for nothing more than the one team-wide `caps` that every member may send: the word sits inside the signed envelope, so it is the sender's own and a hello of one device never speaks for another. The earlier rule (a presence from a device not heard for `PRESENCE_ONLINE_MS` zeroed the caps clock) now marks them due the same way (the spacing holds) and only for a device seen before: a device first seen after this one started has said `hello` or been told ours. `FakeRelay` now replays the last ephemeral of each sender and kind past the Last-Event-ID, as the real relay does (`EventsAfter`), and the restart tests (`tests/link-caps-restart.test.ts`, and `OW-F001` in `tests/server-operate-wiring.test.ts`) set the stored cursor past everything the relay holds, as a queued envelope leaves it.
- **A box with no `operate` in its policy is offered to nobody (OW-F002).** `operateOn` (HolderOptions, given by the service to an unattended holder with an `operate` sink) says whether the policy grants any device `operate` now (`operateGranted`: an unattended policy that reads, with `operate` not refused, with a device named). `operate/1` is in the caps only while it says so; the holder reads it at each tick (it already reads the policy for its config), marks the caps due when it changes, and tells `operateChanged` at the first tick and at each change. main.ts builds the box's bridge (`boxOf`) only when the policy grants operate, from the first operate message or from `operateChanged(true)`; an `open` that arrives while the policy grants nobody is dropped before any bridge exists, so there is no policy watch (the `fs.watch` and the 2 s poll start at the first `open`), no ledger, no timer and no `link.log` line. A controller never opens to such a box (its caps lack `operate/1`), so the 10-minute `open`/`not-granted` round and the page's 「這台機器不讓這部裝置操作」 note are gone for a box nobody granted.
- **The box reads its own net (OW-F009 and the boss's addition).** While the policy grants operate, `operateWire`'s `net.start()` reads the box's net (a fresh reading, since no page or session keeps it current) once at once and every 30 s (`netMs`; `operateNetMs` of the service deps in tests), so a run that starts and ends while nobody is connected still gets a ledger row. `operateChanged(false)` and the bridge's `stop()` stop it; a box with no `operate` grant has no timer. (This replaces the known gap noted under the ledger's observer.)
- **Transcripts, the controller.** `GET api/transcripts?base=<a box base's id>&before=&limit=` is claimed like `history`: it goes to the session that shows the base (the box scope's first), with `before` and `limit` only, and the answer is rebuilt by schema: each row's `id` becomes `key`, a page key (`x` and 16 hex) registered with the session like a key seen on a stream, so `api/history`, `api/entry` and `api/image` for it go to the box as `t<id>`; the box's own id is never passed on. A request with no base, or a base no session shows, is not a box's (the local route answers 404 as before). Which session a list asks is the one holding the base, so a team's session lists its team's rows; a page that wants the box part's rows shows the base of a `box` scope session.
- **Transcripts, the box.** A `t<id>` has no owner in the registry, so the guard's unit check does not apply to a read of one (`history`, `entry`, `image`) or a watch of one: the grant and the policy are still checked, and the seam's hub answers by the session's scope through the ledger (404 when it is not in it). The seam gives a session `transcripts` and takes a `t<id>` the ledger shows it as in scope for reads and watches only (`reads` in `open`), so a write route on a `t<id>` stays out of scope, and a watch ends at a `rescope` when the ledger stops showing the run. `GET api/transcripts` is a read of the box and is logged as `operate-read` with `what: transcripts`.
- **The ledger's observer.** `BoxDeps.observe` runs after each session's snapshot and starts one reading of the box's whole net (`snapshot` with a scope that holds everything, the last reading unless there is none): the registry's refs, the owner of each unit (`operateFacts`), its dispatcher from Herdr's listing (`dispatcherOf`) with the roster's label, the workspace's label, and `live: false` for a finished subagent of that reading. One reading at a time; a call during one is covered by it. The ledger opens when the bridge is built (the first operate message, or the policy's first operate grant) at `<state>/link/operate-ledger.jsonl`, rooted at pi's session folder (the default the net reads from). A failed write is `operate-ledger-failed` with the error's name. **The owner is read again until the run ends (OW-F004).** Herdr's listing is read after the net and before any owner, so a pane the net shows is in it; the owner of a row is `ownerOf(…, settled)`, which answers nobody's (not the box's) while the records that say it are written one after the other: a pane the listing does not hold, the pane's `sb_opened_by` token with no `opened` row yet, or the row with no token yet. Such a unit is in the reading (its row does not end) but gets no row until a reading can place it, and a row it has is not changed by it. While a row is live a reading that places the unit with another owner writes a line of its own (the reload takes the latest line's owner, and the ledger's fold ignores a later owner once the end line is written); a team's run is never moved to the box. After the end line the owner is fixed, as before (OL-F004). A device the reading does not know does not erase the dispatcher the row has.
- **`/boss link operate`, `operate off` and `operate on`** (decision 14, D23) post the page's routes `link/operate`, `link/operate-off` and `link/operate-on`, which are in `LINK_NAMES` and not in `REMOTE_LINK` (a paired device's request is 403) and in the slip guard of the typed commands; the service answers them in `gui` (`operate` on any computer, `[]` on an unattended one; `operate-off` and `operate-on` only attended). **The switch is kept (OW-F003).** `off` closes every session and writes `link/operate-off.json` (`{"since": <ms>}`, mode 600, in the server's state folder: this device's own state); the host opens nothing and stops its clock while it is there, across a GUI that starts again and a server that starts again, until `on` removes it. A file that is there but cannot be read as that still means off. `off` says when the file could not be written (off until the server stops), `on` when it could not be removed (it stays off). `/boss link operate` says "off since <time>" while it is off. (The first wiring paused for a minute; the boss decided on a switch that stays.) `host.status()` lists the sessions that have opened (not an idle one), with the box's label, short id, team name, scope, state, since and the pages connected.
- **What the e2e does not reach.** The pad key travels the whole wire (Mac page, host, relay, box bridge, seam, the box's `control`) and is refused by the box's own guard (`binding-unread`: the test box has no pi bridge to read pi's key bindings from); the box's accepting a key is `tests/operate-keys.test.ts`'s, at the seam. The relay is the fake one (`tests/link/fake-relay.ts`); the real relay's live class is `tests/link-relay-live.test.ts`'s.
- **Second re-review (RR-F001 to F007).** A watch of a `t<id>` key goes through `foundOf`, so a finished run's comms view shows its transcript (`watch.ts`). The host's clock follows the holder: the link service tells the server (`onHolder`) after a holder runs and after it is gone, and the server pulses the host (`operateHost.on()`), so a holder gained after a page is connected, or Link enabled while it is open, starts the clock. A switch file that is anything at all at its path, a dangling symlink included, reads as off. A failed `caps` post sets `due` again, so the tried-again post comes after the spacing, not the hour. A box that loses its last grant drops the bridge and its policy watch once no session is left (`dropBox` in `main.ts`, run when the grant goes and when a session ends; the next grant builds a new bridge). `FakeRelay` refuses a stale ephemeral as `PutEnvelope` does (same sender, kind and addressee set, not newer: not stored), and a test restarts a device with its cursor before the peer's `caps` and no `hello` answered, which only the replay can refill. The unit schema of `operatesanitize.ts` takes the role `train` and its `train` id (a pair that reads back as a pane token), so a box's train and its subagents reach the controller.

### 11.7 Notes from task 7 (the page as built)

**Files.** `gui/boxmodel.ts` (eager: `can`, `canIn`, `baseTitle`, `arrange`), `gui/box.ts` and `gui/boxread.ts` (a lazy chunk: the badge, the states, Earlier runs, the ally fold; what is read from a box), `gui/demo-box.ts` (`?operate=`), and the call sites in `render.ts`, `quit.ts`, `session.ts`, `drawer.ts`, `workspace.ts`, `fixture.ts`, `main.ts`. Tests: `tests/box-model.test.ts`, `tests/box-page.test.ts` (fake document; mutation-checked: the `can` filter, the live-only rule, the ended and unreachable states, the squad menu, the key form).

- **`can` is read as a whole.** The page asks for `close-unit` (Quit on a unit), `close-tab` (Quit squad), `dismiss`, `input` (the composer and the answer panel; the same word the box's `can` carries) and `tower` (Quit tower, the box scope's). A base that is not `live` allows none, whatever its list says. Quit base, Stash and + Main/+ Member are never offered on a remote base, anywhere (decision 9), and nothing in `can` is needed for that. A menu whose only entry is hidden is hidden whole (no empty ⋯).
- **Greyed.** `unreachable` also turns the composer and the answer panel off in the comms view (`input` is not allowed), so nothing is typed into a base whose requests would only time out. The same fact (`can(base, "input")`) greys every other input surface: Zen's composer and answer panels, the dialog tile and the wait card, the terminal key pad (keys, typed text and paste), and the terminal card of a step (Standard's dock slot and Zen's layer: Run, Send Enter, the line and the mask off, a confirm bar withdrawn, `box_keys_blocked` in its status line, the card's `away` fact), and the blocks of an agent's message in the comms log (a form, options, suggestions, a checklist: their answer is the boss's message to the unit, `deliverToUnit`; the log's host passes `away`, `blocks.ts`): an open block is inert with `box_answer_blocked` under it, its confirm step is withdrawn, a late answer from the element posts nothing, and a snapshot (`box()` on the session view, Zen's companion log and a card's context) turns it back on with the box. A block already answered, or on its way, stays as the server's record (`answered.json`) left it. A document's block (`doc.ts`) answers the document's owner through `doc/<cap>/answer`, not a unit's input, so it is not gated; each shows its reason (`box_answer_blocked`, `box_keys_blocked`), and a snapshot redraws the open dialogs and pads when the box goes away or comes back. Local bases are unchanged. The composer's notice then says "This machine cannot be reached right now; sending waits until it can." (`box_blocked`, through the composer's new `away` fact), not that the stream is down.
- **Ended's three sentences.** `policy` and `roster` read 「操作權限已撤銷」; the grant refusals (`not-granted`, `not-admin`, `out-of-scope`, `local-only`) read 「這台機器不讓這部裝置操作」; any other word of the bridge's fixed set reads 「對這台機器的操作已結束」 (new, the spec names two). The once-only rule is the host's (§11.3, the ghost lasts 60 s), not the page's.
- **The ally fold.** Only a live base takes its box's ally card in, under a closed fold ("This machine's status card"), because that card is where the box's last report, a crash notice and the unit-status words are; a greyed or ended base leaves it on the map. A box with several workspaces gives each card to the base named like its workspace, else to the device's first base. A remote base is not wired to the head band (the head tower is this computer's).
- **Earlier runs.** `GET api/transcripts?base=<the base's id>[&before=<cursor>]`; the first page when the base is first live, again when the base's units change (at most every 10 s), a failed list again after 30 s; Show more passes the cursor the box gave. Rows read through `runRows` (key of the form `x<16 hex>`, bounded names); the row's link is the existing session route of that key. A greyed base asks nothing.
- **Title.** The zoomed base's title and the comms header's line add the machine ("Work · agent-tower-01"), since two boxes can both have a workspace "Work".
- **Focus and the box's reason (re-review P3s).** A chat block, the terminal card's line, Run and mask, and a pad key that lose the focus because their box went away (disabled, or inert with the block) get it back when the box returns, if the focus is still on the body (`gui/focusback.ts`: `keepFocus(scope, change)` remembers the control, as ask.ts's `lost` does; a focus or press anywhere else forgets it). A local base's card and pad are not wrapped, so they behave as before. A wait card turned off by an away box (the dock's and Zen's) shows `box_answer_blocked` in its status line (role=status) and in its reply box's note; `wc_stale` and `link_offline` stay for a dropped stream, which wins when both are the cause (`update(next, on, ended, why)`).
- **Not done.** The workspace route and the comms header carry no badge of their own beyond the title; the head band and the minimap treat a remote base like any card (the minimap draws it, the head band does not wire to it).

### 11.9 Notes from the batch review, round 2 (todo #121)

- A wait card of a box's base (the tower note on its base card, the dock dialog, Zen) shows its `url` as selectable text with no Open link and no anchor (`box` option of `waitCard`); the sanitizer's http(s) and no-userinfo check stays, so a bad URL is dropped as before. A local card keeps Open link.
- A box unit's dialog says why its this-computer-only choices are disabled: one line under the choices (`ask_here_only`, class `ask-reason`) and `aria-describedby` on each disabled choice, on the dock, the session view and Zen. It shows only while some choice is disabled.

### 11.8 Notes from the docs task (task 9) and the policy (task P) compared with §13

**Release numbers.** Row 9 says "release a minor (0.62.0)". The release that carries operate is 0.62.0 (R1 and R2 are in straw-relay; the box's bridge, the controller's host, the ledger and the wiring are in the 0.62.0 tag), and the controller's page (task 7) is in 0.64.0. The switch that stays off across restarts and the box's side are therefore in `docs/releases/0.62.0.md`; 0.64.0 has the page, and a pointer for the rest. (An earlier draft of the notes listed a "known limit across versions": a controller older than 0.62.0 dropping a box's `start` rows. The host and its sanitizer, `start` included, both first shipped in 0.62.0, so no released controller lacks the value and the sentence is gone from the notes, the release notes and how-it-works; batch review BR-F005.)

**Task P as landed** (moldplan-center `main`, MR !81, commits 116b030dd and 9fa846cf8, read only: `ansible/shared/roles/vm/agent_tower/` `defaults/main.yml`, `templates/policy.json.j2`, `files/agent-tower-grants-sync.py` `check_operate`, `build_policy`, `EMPTY_POLICY`, `tasks/assert.yml`, and `tests/infra/test_agent_tower_grants_sync.py`, `test_agent_tower_grants_role.py`). It matches §13 on every point it names: `agent_tower_operate` defaults to `{}`; `policy.json.j2` writes `operate` only when the variable is not empty; `load_base` checks the map (device id shape, `team` or `box`, every id at `dispatch` in the base `trust`); `build_policy` copies the base with `dict(base)` so `operate` passes through unchanged and a grants document never adds or changes it; `EMPTY_POLICY` has no `operate`; and the box's own device id is refused in `operate`. It differs from §13 in three places, none of which loosens anything:
- **A bad `operate` costs more than operate.** §3.1 and §13 say a malformed `operate` turns operate off box-wide and leaves the rest in force; that is what pi-straw-boss does when it reads such a file. The sync, though, refuses the whole base when `check_operate` raises (as it does for a malformed `trust`), so the box serves no controller at all until the base is fixed. The role's runbook says so. It cannot happen through the inventory, because `assert.yml` stops the play first on the same checks.
- **The check is also made in `assert.yml`**, tagged `assert` and `policy`, so `--tags policy,verify` does not skip it; and the runbook adds an offboarding step (an operate holder is a base controller, so hq's revoke and the grants kill switch do not end it).
- **The box's own id** is refused by `check_operate` only when the sync's config names the box's id (`box_device_id`), and by `assert.yml` always; §13 only said the id stays out of `operate` and `trust`.

The pi-straw-boss side reads the same shape (`src/link/policy.ts`, `operateOf`), including the extra rule that a device in `operate` below `dispatch` has no effect (`policy-operate-idle`, logged once).

**The batch review of the whole change-set (BR-F001 to BR-F008).** One fresh reviewer read `v0.61.2..70ca3097` (operate parts) and found P0=0, P1=0 and the eight below. Tests: `tests/operate-batch.test.ts` (and the files named per finding); each code fix was seen red first and each guard was reverted alone to see its test go red.

- **BR-F001 (P2), one box's base in two sessions.** A box that serves two of the controller's teams gets one session per team, and each shows the same base ids. The controller (`operatehost.ts`) now asks the session that shows the thing named: `close/tab` goes to a session that holds the tab (`sessionForTab`: live first, the box scope's first); Earlier runs (`transcripts?base=`) asks every live session that shows the base and puts the lists together (a run both list is one row, newest first, 50 to a page; the next page's cursor is given to each session as its own id of the run, else as the largest id, so a tie may come twice and the page drops a row it has; a cursor no live session gave is a 400); a workspace watch (`w:`) runs on every live session that shows the base, and the cards of all of them reach the page. A unit's other actions already went to the session that shows it. A watch of a unit is still on one session.
- **BR-F002 (P2), wait cards.** The sanitizer (`operatesanitize.ts`, `bossWait`) keeps `state` (`resolved` only), `outcome`, `ended`, `cut`, `card` (type and language from their enums, `happened`, `do`, `after` at 160 characters, `options` at most 4 with labels at 24 and `then` at 120, `url` only `http:` or `https:` without userinfo, on one line and at most 300, `command` at most 300 characters in 4 lines, `secret.name`, and the raiser: name, role, workspace, tab, `gone`, and its unit key rewritten like every key) and `press` (the act from its list, `option` 0 to 3, a reason, when, the main's delivery word, `secretAsked`). A card that does not parse is no card, and the page then draws the wait as one written before cards. A resolved wait is no longer shown open, and Zen shows a box's waits as cards (§14.2).
- **BR-F003 (P2), the head tower.** Nothing of a `box` grant reaches the head tower. On the box: `ownerOf` answers nobody for a unit of role `head`, so no scope holds it; `plan` refuses a head key on every row that names a unit (it was `sessions/*` only); the seam refuses a watch of it and its hub never looks it up or lists it in a workspace. On the controller a box's key of the head's shape (`sb-head`, `sb-head-<8 hex>`) is never put in the tables, so no request or watch can name it. The tests cover `history`, `entry`, `image`, `close/unit`, `dismiss`, `sessions/*`, a watch, and the controller.
- **BR-F004 (P2), decision 16.** `LinkStore` takes `unattended()` and `auditLog` (default 8 MiB and four copies, `AUDIT_LOG`); the server's and the tower runtime's store pass the policy's answer. The policy is read only when the log is over the attended 1 MiB. An attended computer is unchanged. §10's line is corrected.
- **BR-F005 (P3).** The "controller older than 0.62.0 drops a box's `start` rows" sentence was wrong (the host and its sanitizer, `start` included, both first shipped in 0.62.0) and is gone from the release notes, how-it-works and §11.8.
- **BR-F006 (P3), page gates.** (a) The answer panel of a box's unit (the dock's dialog, the session view, Zen) is mounted as a remote one's whatever address the page has, so the choices only this computer may give are disabled and so is a Cancel where all are such, and a choice with `next: "pane"` is disabled too (`box` argument of `mountAsk`; the box refuses both, decisions 7 and 8). (b) A merged base's `state` is live if any session is live, but its `scope` and `can` now come from the live sessions only; where a unit's own session (the one `sessionFor` asks) differs from the base, `box.units[<key>]` carries that session's state, scope and reach, and `locate()` answers `can(...)` for the unit with them. The refusal text still says "this computer's own page"; it is not reachable from a disabled choice.
- **BR-F007 (P3), accepted residual: typed text is not checked against the bindings report.** Under operate a key write named as a key (the pad, a chord) is checked by the bytes it sends against the bindings report (§7.6 a); typed text and paste (`pane.send_text`) get the raw-mode, foreground and empty-editor checks only, and the characters are read by pi as keys. The gap shows only if the box's `keybindings.json` puts an app action on a printable key (space, a digit, a letter): `BYTES` has no printable key but space and the digits, and a stock pi binds none. That file is the box owner's, on a box with no interactive user; it is the same class as the extension-shortcut residual of §10, and refusing the characters of every binding would need the report to list printable bindings, which today it does not. Not fixed; revisit if a box ever binds an action to a printable key.
- **BR-F008 (P3), fixed: a request admitted before a revoke.** `foremost` is the last check before a write; it now also asks the session whether it is still there (`Flags.alive`, given by the seam: not stopped), so a key or text in flight when the grant ended is not typed. What stays is §5.6's own window: a revoke is seen at the next 2-second look at the policy, and a request that passed every check before the session was ended by it still finishes as if it came a moment earlier.

### 11.10 Notes from the live trial's fix round (todo #121, 2026-11-09; 0.67.0)

The live trial on agent-tower-01 (round 1 to 3) found one P2 and three P3s, and one minor item. They are fixed as follows.

- **A close from the operate page drops the main's `opened` route (P2).** `close-unit` and `close-tab` reach the box GUI's closer (`src/closer.ts`), which never knew the route table, so the row an ally run left for a main it opened stayed until a stop found the main gone or the 7-day expiry, and the controller listed a stoppable "opened main" in the meantime. The closer now takes `forget(session)`: it is called for a unit that accepted its close once the broker no longer lists it (the same wait of up to 30 s a batch makes; OT-F002), and that wait and the `forget` run behind the answer, which goes as soon as the close is accepted (OT2-F002: the operate relay gives up on a request after 20 s, so an answer that waited for a slow quit showed the controller a 504 for a close that went through; a failing read of the broker's list is logged as `close-unit-forget-failed`, a main still listed after the wait as `close-unit-listed`, and neither reaches the answer), and for every session a squad or base batch quit once the tab or workspace closed; a refusal, a main that is still listed after the wait, or a batch that stopped forgets nothing. `guihost.ts` hands it the tower panel's `forget` (`towerpanel.ts`), which asks `Towers.forget(session)` (`towers.ts`): every service drops the `opened` row of that session with the same `forgetClosed` the tower's own `boss_close_main` uses (`dropOpened`). Another main's row and any `expect` row stay. A row with a `stop` the box accepted stays too (OT-F001). Dropping it would end the stop with no `unit-stop-done` line and no `main-stop` "stopped" notice, which the "close it by hand" notice sends people to do. `Towers.forget` leaves such a row and asks the revoker to sweep at once (`sweep(true)`); the revoker forgets it, audits and tells the admins as it does for a main that quit by itself (gone after two sweeps with its pane absent, or a quit it was answered). Only a row with a stop is held (OT2-F001): a row with no stop that the revoker merely found short of `dispatch` has no done line or stopped notice waiting (its "gone" path signals only for a stop), and holding it left the route of a closed main until the 7-day expiry once the device had `dispatch` again, because the revoker skips such a device before it asks the main. A route file that cannot be written is logged as `ally-route` and does not undo the close. A close on the box's own page (not a controller's) takes the same path, which is intended: the main is gone either way.
- **Refusal notes on a zh-TW page (P3).** The composer, a wait card and a block answer showed the box's English `reason` for an `operate_refused`; only the key pad said it in the page's language, and only for four words. `gui/termwords.ts` `OPERATE_WHY` now has a sentence, in both languages, for every word the box, the keys and the routes give: `binding`, `binding-unread`, `foreground`, `terminal`, `unread`, `shell`, `boss-command`, `command`, `draft`, `ended`, `route`, `enter-chord`, `chord`, `leaves-editor`, and the box's own `not-granted`, `not-admin`, `out-of-scope`, `local-only`, `policy`. `towerWhy` (composer, wait card, block answer) and `aftermath` read it through `operateWhy`; a word with no sentence keeps the box's text there, and on the key pad and the terminal it still reads the generic `operate_refused` sentence. `tests/termwords.test.ts` reads the words out of the source files, so a new word without a sentence fails it.
- **An ended line on every team's card (P3).** `merged()` in `operatehost.ts` made one "ended" base per device from the first ended session, so a box in two teams showed the sentence on one card. It now makes one per ended session (per team), each with its own id and team, under the same window as before (a refusal shows once for 60 s, a revoke until the session reopens).
- **Earlier runs lists finished runs (P3).** `within(scope).list` skips a row that is open (`ended` unset): a restarted main resumes the same session file, so its pre-restart run was listed beside the live unit. The row is listed once the net stops showing the session. A `t<id>` key of a live row still reads (`has`, `lookup` are unchanged). A ledger row loaded from a file whose server was killed has no end line and is open until the box's first net reading ends it, which `net.start()` makes at once.
- **Not done: the folds of the box's card (minor, CR9).** A page reload closes 「這台機器的狀態卡」 and the Mains fold. The page remembers no fold by device today (the board's and the head log's folds are kept in memory for the page's life, not in `localStorage`), so remembering these two would add a mechanism of its own; it is left.
- **Open residuals of the page's close (recorded, not fixed).**
  - A stop row in a service that is not live (waiting, stopped, or without a control) is dropped by the page's close without its `unit-stop-done` line: `openedRows()` lists only live, controlled, non-head services, so `Towers.forget` does not see the row as one with a stop, and the revoker cannot reach it either. It is the same as before this fix round for those services.
  - A main still listed by the broker 30 s after it accepted a close keeps its route (nothing forgets it later); the server log has `close-unit-listed` for it. The 7-day expiry or a stop that finds it gone ends it.
  - A batch (`close-tab`, `close-base`, stash, close-all) has the same 30 s wait against the relay's 20 s: a quit that takes 20 to 30 s shows the controller a 504 although the batch goes on and closes the tab. Its answer carries what decides whether the tab closes (`still_running` keeps it open), so it cannot be answered before the wait as a unit's can; fixing it needs a wait shorter than the relay's or a way to ask for the result later.
  - A page close of a row with no stop that the revoker had told the admins about as "could not be ended yet" is not followed by an "ended" notice.
