// The page's one playback core: every view's sounds (the Standard chime and clips, Zen's later sounds and music, Raven's weather) play through one AudioContext and one gain for each of the two classes (todo #139).
// A sound is one of two classes: `effects` (the cues of events: the clips, Zen's bowl and knock) and `background` (what plays under the page: Zen's music, Raven's rain and thunder). Each class has its own gain,
// which follows the square of that class's Volume (0 to 100; an iPhone honours a gain); a class's switch is the source's own check, so a source asks the core for its class by name and no sound reaches the output without one.
// The context is made at the first play or unlock and resumed at each (a browser that blocks sound before any press keeps it suspended).
// `out(class)` is for the views' own nodes (Zen's effects, its music bus in audiobus.ts); `running()` says whether a sound due now would be heard (a suspended context queues it; Zen drops an effect instead).
