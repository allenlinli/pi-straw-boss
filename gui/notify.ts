// Reminders and sounds for the alerts a snapshot raises: a unit waiting on an answer, one that finished, one that failed.
// Each has a switch on the settings page (This device), kept per browser: reminders on, sounds off, so a page that opens makes no noise. The switch is a button that says its
// state in a word (On, Off). Sound is two classes (todo #139), each with a switch and a volume (0 to 100, default 60) under it: Sound effects (these cues, with a try) and Background sound (Zen's music, Raven's rain and thunder,
// which play from their own code, so this file only keeps its switch and volume); the sounds play through Web Audio, whose gain an iPhone honours (it ignores an audio element's volume).
// A reminder is a system notification while the page is hidden or unfocused (the alert queue shows it on a focused page);
// clicking it brings the page forward on that unit. Only a question is urgent: a failure or a finish shows a silent system notification, and with Sound effects on plays its
// own softer clip (the error clip) beside the question's. A batch plays one sound, the most urgent of its marks.
